 Regular users (righteously) often find it an unbearable nuisance to
 care for the configuration of BOINC for the OpenCL-savvy AMD/ATI
 graphics cards.  This package adds a series of dependencies from the
 non-free section to the regular boinc package. This also meant this
 binary package to be redistributed in the contrib section of Debian.

 performs successive DMRG sweeps according to a user-defined
 convergence scheme. As output, the library returns the minimal
 encountered energy as well as the second order reduced density
 matrix (2-RDM) of the active space. With the latter, various
 molecular properties can be calculated, as well as the gradient and
 Hessian for orbital rotations or nuclear displacements. In addition,
 several correlation functions can be obtained to investigate the
 electronic structure in the active space.

 Gitolite is an SSH-based gatekeeper providing access control for a server that
 hosts many git repositories. Without gitolite,
 each developer needing to push to one of the repositories hosted would need a
 user account on that server; gitolite lets you do that just using
 SSH public keys tied to a single, common, user that hosts all the
 repositories.
 .
 Gitolite can restrict who can read (clone/fetch) from or write
 (push) to a repository, and who can push to what branch or tag - an
 important issue in corporate environments. Other features include:
   * access control by branch-name or by modified file/directory;
   * per-developer "personal namespace" prefixes;
   * simple but powerful configuration file syntax (with validation);
   * config files (and authority for maintaining them) can be split;
   * easy integration with gitweb;
   * comprehensive logging;
   * easy migration from gitosis.

Description-en: Go programming language compiler - metapackage
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and
 efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
 that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its
 novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.
 Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of
 garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a
 dynamically typed, interpreted language.

Description-md5: 9c3ca8edc97a53189e3cb27b4118a5ca
Description-en: Funny turn-based artillery game, featuring fighting Hedgehogs!
 Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the
 course of the game, players take turns with one of their
 hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are
 available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby
 winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a
 variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by
 using particular tools such as the "Rope" or "Parachute", to
 move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited
 to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive
 thinking or moving.
 .
 A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players
 during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Homing Bee,
 Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine,
 Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause
 explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks.
 The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a
 restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when
 it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or
 through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either
 side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from
 contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the
 attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is
 shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).

 chemps2 is a scientific library which contains a spin-adapted
 implementation of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
 for ab initio quantum chemistry. This method allows one to obtain
 numerical accuracy in active spaces beyond the capabilities of
 full configuration interaction (FCI): up to 40 electrons in 40
 orbitals for general active spaces; and up to 100 electrons in
 100 orbitals for one-dimensional active spaces, such as the
 pi-system of all-trans polyenes.
 .
 For an input Hamiltonian and targeted symmetry sector, the library
 performs successive DMRG sweeps according to a user-defined
 convergence scheme. As output, the library returns the minimal
 encountered energy as well as the second order reduced density
 matrix (2-RDM) of the active space. With the latter, various
 molecular properties can be calculated, as well as the gradient and
 Hessian for orbital rotations or nuclear displacements. In addition,
 several correlation functions can be obtained to investigate the
 electronic structure in the active space.
 .
 This version of chemps2 is parallelized for shared memory
 architectures with OpenMP.

Description-en: Galois Field Arithmetic - development files
 Galois Field arithmetic forms the backbone of erasure-coded storage systems,
 most famously the Reed-Solomon erasure code. A Galois Field is defined over
 w-bit words and is termed GF(2w). As such, the elements of a Galois Field are
 the integers 0, 1, . . ., 2^w − 1. Galois Field arithmetic defines addition
 and multiplication over these closed sets of integers in such a way that they
 work as you would hope they would work. Specifically, every number has a
 unique multiplicative inverse. Moreover, there is a value, typically the value
 2, which has the property that you can enumerate all of the non-zero elements
 of the field by taking that value to successively higher powers.

 Ecogene data set (except those containing introns).
 It possesses a very sophisticated ribosomal binding site scoring system that
 enables it to locate the translation initiation site with great accuracy
 (96% of the 5' ends in the Ecogene data set are located correctly).
 .
 Specificity: Prodigal's false positive rate compares favorably with other
 gene identification programs, and usually falls under 5%.
 .
 GC-Content Indifferent: Prodigal performs well even in high GC genomes,
 with over a 90% perfect match (5'+3') to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa curated
 annotations.

 sequences even when the organism is unknown.
 .
 Ease of Use: Prodigal can be run in one step on a single genomic sequence
 or on a draft genome containing many sequences. It does not need to be
 supplied with any knowledge of the organism, as it learns all the properties
 it needs to on its own.

 For an input Hamiltonian and targeted symmetry sector, the library
 performs successive DMRG sweeps according to a user-defined
 convergence scheme. As output, the library returns the minimal
 encountered energy as well as the second order reduced density
 matrix (2-RDM) of the active space. With the latter, various
 molecular properties can be calculated, as well as the gradient and
 Hessian for orbital rotations or nuclear displacements. In addition,
 several correlation functions can be obtained to investigate the

Package: twine
Description-md5: 0b366f69c74677ed9020904fb219e354
Description-en: utility for interacting with PyPI
 Twine is a tool for uploading distributions (in the python meaning) to PyPi.
 .
 Why Should I Use This?
 .
 The biggest reason to use twine is that python setup.py upload uploads files
 over plaintext. This means anytime you use it you expose your username and
 password to a MITM attack. Twine uses only verified TLS to upload to PyPI
 protecting your credentials from theft.
 .
 Secondly it allows you to precreate your distribution files. python setup.py
 upload only allows you to upload something that you’ve created in the same
 command invocation. This means that you cannot test the exact file you’re
 going to upload to PyPI to ensure that it works before uploading it.
 .
 Finally it allows you to pre-sign your files and pass the .asc files into the
 command line invocation (twine upload twine-1.0.1.tar.gz
 twine-1.0.1.tar.gz.asc). This enables you to be assured that you’re typing
 your gpg passphrase into gpg itself and not anything else since you will be
 the one directly executing gpg --detach-sign -a <filename>.
 .
 Features:
 .
  - Verified HTTPS Connections
  - Uploading doesn’t require executing setup.py
  - Uploading files that have already been created, allowing testing of
    distributions before release
  - Supports uploading any packaging format (including wheels).
