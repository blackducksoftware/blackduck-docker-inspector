Package: clustalw
Description-md5: 633246bd8fd1b951f15985f7cbfb1909
Description-en: global multiple nucleotide or peptide sequence alignment
 This program performs an alignment of multiple nucleotide or amino acid
 sequences. It recognizes the format of input sequences and whether the
 sequences are nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) or amino acid (proteins). The output
 format may be selected from in various formats for multiple alignments such as
 Phylip or FASTA. Clustal W is very well accepted.
 .
 The output of Clustal W can be edited manually but preferably with an
 alignment editor like SeaView or within its companion Clustal X. When building
 a model from your alignment, this can be applied for improved database
 searches. The Debian package hmmer creates such in form of an HMM.

Package: clustalw-mpi
Description-md5: d0fe5d7d5d49a1a097a450ec20cd8cdc
Description-en: MPI-distributed global sequence alignment with ClustalW
 ClustalW is a popular tool for multiple sequence alignment. The
 alignment is achieved via three steps: pairwise alignment,
 guide-tree generation and progressive alignment. ClustalW-MPI is an
 MPI implementation of ClustalW. Based on
 version 1.82 of the original ClustalW, both the pairwise
 and progressive alignments are parallelized with MPI, a
 popular message passing programming standard. The
 pairwise alignments can be easily parallelized since the many
 alignments are time independent on each other. However
 the progressive alignments are essentially not parallelizable
 because of the time dependencies between each alignment.
 .
 Here the recursive parallelism paradigm is applied to the linear space
 profile-profile alignment algorithm. This approach is more time
 efficient on computers with distributed memory architecture.
 Traditional approach that relies on precomputing the profile-profile
 score matrix has also been implemented. Results shown the latter is indeed
 more appropriate for shared memory multiprocessor computer.
 .
 ClustalX is suggested for its support for local realignments, seaview
 is a versatile editor of alignments.
 .
 The original ClustalW/ClustalX can be found at
 URL: http://www.clustal.org/download/pre-2/

Package: clustalx
Description-md5: a79728f91dcfed21b62f89dea1743319
Description-en: Multiple alignment of nucleic acid and protein sequences (graphical interface)
 This package offers a GUI interface for the Clustal multiple sequence
 alignment program. It provides an integrated environment for performing
 multiple sequence- and profile-alignments to analyse the results.
 The sequence alignment is displayed in a window on the screen.
 A versatile coloring scheme has been incorporated to highlight conserved
 features in the alignment. For professional presentations, one should
 use the texshade LaTeX package or boxshade.
 .
 The pull-down menus at the top of the window allow you to select all the
 options required for traditional multiple sequence and profile alignment.
 You can cut-and-paste sequences to change the order of the alignment; you can
 select a subset of sequences to be aligned; you can select a sub-range of the
 alignment to be realigned and inserted back into the original alignment.
 .
 An alignment quality analysis can be performed and low-scoring segments or
 exceptional residues can be highlighted.

Description-md5: 9545784f9afb64749d366694bd0672ca
Description-en: donate unused CPU cycles - client for distributed.net
 Donate your extra CPU cycles to a worthy cause!
 .
 distributed.net started in 1997 as a project whose purpose was to win a
 series of contests sponsored by RSA Data Security Inc., to crack their RC5
 encryption by brute-force methods. These contests were meant to show
 governments of nations such as the United States, who limit exports or
 use of cryptography, that the standards allowed are too weak for general
 use.
 .
 Since this time, distributed.net has changed their focus from solely
 cracking RSA's RC5 and DES projects to working on more diverse
 distributed computing problems.
 .
 The ongoing projects are RC5-72 and Optimal Golomb Rulers (25-mark), the
 latter of which has practical applications in science. There are also a
 number of other projects which are either periodic or upcoming. You may
 choose which project you wish to participate in.
 .
 By installing this package, unused CPU cycles on your computer will be used
 to work on cracking the code. There should be no noticeable slowdown of
 your system, since the client runs niced, and only uses CPU time when
 your computer would otherwise be idle.
 .

Package: dynare-matlab
Description-md5: 90e8fcabb135fcf60e09f0be51774946
Description-en: MATLAB support for Dynare
 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
 particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
 generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
 the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
 about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able
 to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme,
 models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme,
 models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
 state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning
 process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate
 consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and
 financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by
 including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned
 agent categories.
 .
 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It
 is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model
 parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In
 practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model
 variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the
 computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical
 outputs.
 .
 This package is only useful to users having MATLAB installed on their
 machine. It contains the source of the MEX files and will recompile them using
 the existing MATLAB installation.

 the concatenation of diphones. It takes a list of phonemes as input,
 together with prosodic information (duration of phonemes and a piecewise linear
 description of pitch), and produces speech samples on 16 bits (linear),
 at the sampling frequency of the diphone database.

 with a special focus on supporting the use of the Relaxed
 Complex Scheme. It includes web based access to applications
 such as NAMD, AutoDock, PDB2PQR, APBS, MGLToos and couples them
 in a flexible and scalable fashion through cloud computing.
 It is developed as a standalone application, using Vision
 (https://www.nbcr.net/pub/wiki/index.php?title=MGLTools#Vision) as
 the backend engine for visual programming and workflow execution.
 The scientific applications are made accessible through CADD using
 Opal Web services (https://www.nbcr.net/pub/wiki/index.php?title=Opal)
 for scalable and distributed computation.
 .
 The workflow components of the CADD pipeline are currently released
 as Vision networks packaged for specific processes in a modular
 fashion. These modules may be coupled at ease for more complex
 processes. In the future, they may also be accessible from workflow
 repositories such as MyExperiment.org, and from AutoDockTools.  The Opal
 services used in the CADD workflow may be accessed using programmatic
 access, the Opal Server Dashboard or other workflow clients such as
 Kepler, VisTrails or Taverna through Opal plugins available at Opal
 Sourceforge website (http://opal.nbcr.net).

 SiSU is a lightweight markup based, command line oriented, document
 structuring, publishing and search framework for document collections.
 .
 With minimal preparation of a plain-text, (UTF-8) file, using its native
 markup syntax in your text editor of choice, SiSU can generate various
 document formats (most of which share a common object numbering system for
 locating content), including plain text, HTML, XHTML, XML, EPUB, OpenDocument
 text (ODF:ODT), LaTeX, PDF files, and populate an SQL database with objects
 (roughly paragraph-sized chunks) so searches may be performed and matches
 returned with that degree of granularity: your search criteria is met by these
 documents and at these locations within each document. Object numbering is

Package: snaphu
Description-md5: 6ac13ac4c3384f0d55c3268461aa73d3
Description-en: Statistical-Cost, Network-Flow Algorithm for 2D Phase Unwrapping
 Two-dimensional phase unwrapping is the process of recovering
 unambiguous phase data from a 2-D array of phase values known only
 modulo 2pi rad.
 .
 There are many applications, like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), fringe pattern analysis, tomography
 and spectroscopy, which as part of their fundamental operation depend
 upon the extraction of a phase signal from their input image. Usually
 the phase is available in a form that suffers from 2-pi phase jumps
 due to the use of the mathematical arctangent function, which produces
 an inherently wrapped output. This wrapped phase is unusable until the
 phase discontinuities are removed.
 .
 SNAPHU is an implementation of the Statistical-cost, Network-flow
 Algorithm for Phase Unwrapping particularly suitable for SAR
 interferometry applications. This algorithm poses phase unwrapping as
 a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem, the
 objective of which is to compute the most likely unwrapped solution
 given the observable input data. Because the statistics relating the
 input data to the solution depend on the measured quantity, SNAPHU
 incorporates three built-in statistical models, for topography data,
 deformation data, and smooth generic data. The posed optimization
 problem is solved approximately with use of network-flow techniques.
 .
 As SNAPHU uses an iterative optimization procedure, its execution time
 depends on the difficulty of the interferogram. In single-tile mode
 the required memory is on the order of 100 MB per 1,000,000 pixels in
 the input interferogram.

Package: sparse
Description-md5: da8c616b0e917184b61c1bd49923fb4d
Description-en: semantic parser of source files
 Sparse, the semantic parser, provides a compiler frontend capable of
 parsing most of ANSI C as well as many GCC extensions, and a collection
 of sample compiler backends, including a static analyzer also called
 "sparse". Sparse provides a set of annotations designed to convey
 semantic information about types, such as what address space pointers
 point to, or what locks a function acquires or releases.
 .
 Sparse can be invoked directly as "sparse" or via the "cgcc" wrapper
 around the C compiler.

Package: tome
Description-md5: 79dff9cc36d9958abb1bf5894cc413a2
Description-en: A single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation game.
 Tome, short for Troubles of Middle Earth, is a single-player,
 text-based, dungeon simulation derived from the game angband, which
 in turn is derived from the older game Moria, which was in turn based
 on Rogue. It is often described as a "roguelike" game because the
 look and feel of the game is still quite similar to Rogue.
 .
 In tome, the  player may choose from a number of races and classes
 when creating a character, and then "run" that character over a
 period of days, weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by
 defeating Morgoth, who lurks somewhere in  the depths of the dungeon.
 .
 The ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough
 to defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so,
 you will receive the exalted status of "winner" and your character may

 .
 The first main difference from Angband a new player to ToME will need
 to be aware of is that it has implemented a skills based system where
 instead of the  adventurer automatically improving in their abilities
 as they become more experienced, they get 5 skill points to spend on
 their character's abilities and can therefore customise what type of
 character they play. See the skills help file for details
 .
 The second major difference is that the main dungeon from Angband has
 been split  into 4 "dungeons", each of which cover a different
 portion of the dungeon's  levels. Note that not all of the places are
 actually "dungeons" - some are caves, forests, etc.
 .
 The third main difference between Vanilla Angband and ToME is the
 difference  in character classes and races, as well as a very
 different  magic system. ToME also offers the player the ability to
 undertake a series of  quests. It is not required for any adventurer
 to undertake  the fixed  quests, but they can result in some nice
 rewards.
 .
 Morgoth was 'the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth' during its First Age. He
 was banished by the Valar (offspring of Eru, "god" of J.R.R.
 Tolkien's world) at the end of the First Age and thus never appears
 in The Lord of the Rings, set during the Third Age. Sauron, who does
 figure into those tales, was the most powerful of his servants. Read
 Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion' for more on the legends of Middle-Earth.
 Angband is a reference to Morgoth's "prison of iron."

 provides the libflashsupport.so plugin.  The sound system to use is
 automatically detected:
 .
  * It first tries to detect Esound,
  * Next, it checks for OSS.
 .
 If all of the above failed, it falls back to the ALSA driver that's
 built directly into FlashPlayer 9.
 .
 For PulseAudio support, see flashplugin-nonfree-pulse.
