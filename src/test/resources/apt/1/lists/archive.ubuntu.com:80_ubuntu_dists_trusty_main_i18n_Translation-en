 bibliographies, and viewers) from inside Emacs.  AUCTeX allows browsing
 through the errors reported by TeX, while it moves the cursor directly to
 the reported error, and displays some documentation for that particular
 error.  This will even work when the document is spread over several
 files.

 BackupPC is disk based and not tape based. This particularity allows
 features not found in any other backup solution:
  * Clever pooling scheme minimizes disk storage and disk I/O.
    Identical files across multiple backups of the same or different PC are
    stored only once resulting in substantial savings in disk storage and disk
    writes. Also known as "data deduplication".
  * Optional compression provides additional reductions in storage.
    CPU impact of compression is low since only new files (those not already
    in the pool) need to be compressed.
  * A powerful http/cgi user interface allows administrators to view log files,
    configuration, current status and allows users to initiate and cancel
    backups and browse and restore files from backups very quickly.
  * No client-side software is needed. On WinXX the smb protocol is used.
    On Linux or Unix clients, rsync or tar (over ssh/rsh/nfs) can be used
  * Flexible restore options. Single files can be downloaded from any backup
    directly from the CGI interface. Zip or Tar archives for selected files
    or directories can also be downloaded from the CGI interface.
  * BackupPC supports mobile environments where laptops are only intermittently
    connected to the network and have dynamic IP addresses (DHCP).
  * Flexible configuration parameters allow multiple backups to be performed
    in parallel.
  * and more to discover in the manual...

Package: bdf2psf
Description-md5: 5eb98031ca1e36678eeeefee0d31085b
Description-en: font converter to generate console fonts from BDF source fonts
 This package provides a command-line converter that can be used in
 scripts to build console fonts from BDF sources automatically. The
 converter comes with a collection of font encodings that cover many
 of the world's languages. The output font can use a different
 character encoding from the input. When the source font does not
 define a glyph for a particular symbol in the encoding table, that
 glyph position in the console font is not wasted but used for another
 symbol.
 .
 When deciding about the position in the font for a particular glyph,
 the converter takes into account that in text video modes the video
 adapter copies the eighth column of the glyph matrix of symbols
 positioned in the pseudographic area to the ninth column. In order to
 create fonts for text video modes, the width of the glyph matrix of
 the source BDF font should be seven, eight, or nine pixels; otherwise the
 converter creates fonts suitable for framebuffer only.

 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 busybox-initramfs provides a simple stand alone shell that provides
 only the basic utilities needed for the initramfs.

Description-en: Berkeley YACC parser generator extended to generate Java code
 BYACC/J is an extension of the Berkeley v 1.8 YACC-compatible parser
 generator.
 .
 Standard YACC takes a YACC source file, and generates one or more C files from
 it, which if compiled properly, will produce a LALR-grammar parser. This is
 useful for expression parsing, interactive command parsing, and file reading.
 Many megabytes of YACC code have been written over the years.
 .
 This is the standard YACC tool that is in use every day to produce C/C++
 parsers.
 .
 I have added a "-J" flag which will cause BYACC to generate Java source code,
 instead. So there finally is a YACC for Java now!

 Publishing of branches can be done over plain HTTP, that is, no special
 software is needed on the server to host Bazaar branches. Branches can
 be pushed to the server via sftp (which most SSH installations come
 with), FTP, or over a custom and faster protocol if bzr is installed in

    completely integrated with gdb in order to be able to display
    formatted kernel data structures, disassemble source code, etc.
 .
 o  The current set of available commands consist of common kernel core
    analysis tools such as a context-specific stack traces, source code
    disassembly, kernel variable displays, memory display, dumps of
    linked-lists, etc.  In addition, any gdb command may be entered,
    which in turn will be passed onto the gdb module for execution.
 .
 o  There are several commands that delve deeper into specific kernel
    subsystems, which also serve as templates for kernel developers
    to create new commands for analysis of a specific area of interest.
    Adding a new command is a simple affair, and a quick recompile
    adds it to the command menu.
 .
 o  The intent is to make the tool independent of Linux version dependencies,
    building in recognition of major kernel code changes so as to adapt to
    new kernel versions, while maintaining backwards compatibility.

Description-md5: 62e6daa6a4968f3b8a09c5e8724afc0c
Description-en: Concurrent Versions System
 CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep access
 to old versions  of files (usually source code), keep a log of
 who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.

 enable/log/control various operations, and can work over a wide
 area network. The texinfo manual provides further information on
 more tasks that it can perform.
 .
 There are some tasks that are not covered by CVS. They can be done in
 conjunction with CVS but will tend to require some script-writing and
 software other than CVS. These tasks are bug-tracking, build management
 (that is, make and make-like tools), and automated testing. However,
 CVS makes these tasks easier.

 repository.  A patch set in this case is defined as a set of changes made
 to a collection of files, all committed at the same time (using a single
 'cvs commit' command).  This information is valuable for seeing the
 big picture of the evolution of a CVS project.  While CVS tracks revision
 information, it is often difficult to see what changes were committed
 'atomically' to the repository.

 This script is designed to be run at build-time, and registers in a
 file the list of packages declared as build-time dependencies, as
 well as build-essential packages, together with their versions, as
 installed in the build machine.
 .
 This will hopefully help to track packages (auto-)built with package
 versions which are known to be buggy, and, more generally, to find
 out whether a package needs to be rebuilt because of a significant
 change in a package it has a build-time dependency on.

Package: dh-di
Description-md5: d31938dbb9a87daa76cd0914921cf8da

Description-en: Scripts to help with executable debhelper files
 Debhelper (in compat level 9 and above) allows its config files to be
 executable, and uses the output of suchs scripts as if it was the
 content of the config file.
 .
 To ease and standardize the most common tasks, this package provides
 a few solutions to help constructing such executable scripts:
 .
  * A way to ease variable substitution, from environment variables or
    dpkg-architecture.
  * An extension to dh_install, with the ability to rename files.

Package: dh-linktree
Description-md5: 2db0ade7f7e567b15612bded5502ce65
Description-en: Create symlink trees within a Debian package
 Many developers bundle PHP or JavaScript libraries in the software that
 they provide. The Debian packager must then replace those "embedded copies"
 with symlinks to the packaged copy of those files. This operation is not
 without risks. A version mismatch can be the source of bugs that are hard to
 track.
 .
 dh_linktree is a tool that can assist you in this task. It can either
 unconditionnaly install a symlink tree of a given directory at the place
 of your choice, or it can only replace existing files with symlinks, or it
 can only replace existing identical files with symlinks.

Description-md5: 1a811f1261ebf8d94f48be93de246b96
Description-en: debhelper extension for scanning kernel module aliases
 dh_modaliases is useful for packages that ship third-party kernel modules,
 either in binary form, or as sources (with e. g. DKMS). It extracts the
 modules' modaliases from either the compile .ko files themselves (for packages
 which ship them in compiled form, using modinfo), or from a package file
 debian/packagename.modaliases.
 .
 This enables software which is looking for missing driver packages (such as
 Jockey or the operating system installer) to identify which package(s) will
 provide a driver for a piece of hardware, identified by its modalias.

 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 A daemon that dynamically updates a relay authorization map for some
 MTA (postfix, sendmail). It provides a way to allow legitimate users
 to relay mail through an SMTP server, while still preventing others
 from using it as a spam relay. User's IP addresses are added to the
 map immediately after they have authenticated to the POP or IMAP
 server. By default, map entries expire after 30 minutes, but can be
 renewed by additional authentication. Periodically checking mail on
 a POP server is sufficient to do this. The POP and SMTP servers can
 be on different hosts.

Package: eatmydata
Description-md5: 8b35348223c5f515ecb4a88949a00006
Description-en: library and utilities designed to disable fsync and friends
 This package contains a small LD_PRELOAD library (libeatmydata) and a couple
 of helper utilities designed to transparently disable fsync and friends (like
 open(O_SYNC)). This has two side-effects: making software that writes data
 safely to disk a lot quicker and making this software no longer crash safe.
 .
 You will find eatmydata useful if particular software calls fsync(), sync()
 etc. frequently but the data it stores is not that valuable to you and you may
 afford losing it in case of system crash. Data-to-disk synchronization calls
 are typically very slow on modern file systems and their extensive usage might
 slow down software significantly. It does not make sense to accept such a hit
 in performance if data being manipulated is not very important.
 .
 On the other hand, do not use eatmydata when you care about what software
 stores or it manipulates important components of your system. The library is
 called libEAT-MY-DATA for a reason.

Package: fonts-sil-nuosusil
Description-md5: d6ea72c7c14321fad5939a643e9354f8
Description-en: Unicode font for Yi (a script used in southwestern China)
 The Nuosu SIL font was originally named SIL Yi and developed in 2000
 as a single Unicode font for the standardized Yi script used by a
 large ethnic group in southwestern China.
 .
 The traditional Yi scripts have been in use for centuries, and have a
 tremendous number of local variants. The script was standardized in the
 1970's by the Chinese government. In the process of standardization, 820
 symbols from the traditional scripts of the Liangshan region were chosen
 to form a syllabary.
 .
 The syllable inventory of a speech variety from Xide County, Sichuan
 was used as the phonological basis for standardization. For the most part
 there is one symbol per phonologically-distinct syllable and vice-versa.
 The direction of writing and reading was standardized as left-to-right.
 Punctuation symbols were borrowed from Chinese, and a diacritic was
 incorporated into the system to mark one of the tones.

 Scheherazade, named after the heroine of the classic Arabian Nights
 tale, is designed in a similar style to traditional typefaces such as

 issues.

 basic connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional
 ligatures or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef
 ligatures). This simplified style is often preferred for clarity,
 especially in non-Arabic languages, but may be considered unattractive
 in more traditional and literate communities.

 character repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks,

Package: fonts-wqy-microhei
Description-md5: c32a7f886f6870b4b8e9be19f98fbef8
Description-en: Sans-serif style CJK font derived from Droid
 WenQuanYi Micro Hei font family is a sans-serif style (also known as Hei,
 Gothic or Dotum among the Chinese/Japanese/Korean users) high quality
 CJK outline font. It was derived from "Droid Sans Fallback", "Droid
 Sans" and "Droid Sans Mono" released by Google Corp. This font package
 contains two faces, "Micro Hei" and "Micro Hei Mono", in form of a
 TrueType Collection (ttc) file. All the unified CJK Han glyphs, i.e.
 GBK Hanzi, in the range of U+4E00-U+9FC3 defined in Unicode Standard 5.1
 are covered, with additional support to many other international
 languages such as Latin, Extended Latin, Hanguls and Kanas. The font
 file is extremely compact (~5M) compared with most known CJK fonts.
 As a result, it can be used for hand-held devices or embedded systems, or
 used on PC with a significantly small memory footprint. Because both
 font faces carry hinting and kerning instructions for Latin glyphs,
 they are excellent choices for desktop fonts.

 enhance on-screen performance, and can be enabled with the provided
 configuration files.
 .

 Hanzi glyphs, including both simplified and traditional forms.

 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Package: latex-beamer
Description-md5: d2345de1842406c63c25458fb9c962ce
Description-en: LaTeX class to produce presentations
 The beamer class is a LaTeX class that allows you to create a beamer
 presentation. It can also be used to create slides. It behaves
 similarly to other packages like Prosper, but has the advantage that
 it works together directly with pdflatex, but also with dvips.
 .
 Once you have installed the beamer class, the basic steps to create a
 beamer presentation are the following:
  - Specify beamer as document class instead of article.
  - Structure your LaTeX text using \section and \subsection commands.
  - Place the text of the individual slides inside \frame commands.
  - Run pdflatex on the text (or latex and dvips).
 .
 The beamer class has several useful features: You don't need any
 external programs to use it other than pdflatex, but it works also
 with dvips. You can easily and intuitively create sophisticated
 overlays. Finally, you can easily change the whole slide theme or only
 parts of it.

Package: latex2html
Description-md5: c54cf0081b5e186a36ce7c53ee9032c9
Description-en: LaTeX to HTML translator
 LaTeX2HTML is a conversion tool that converts documents written
 in LaTeX to HTML format. In addition, it offers an easy migration
 path towards authoring complex hypermedia documents using familiar
 word-processing concepts.
 .
 LaTeX2HTML replicates the basic structure of a LaTeX document as a
 set of interconnected HTML files which can be explored using
 automatically generated navigation panels. The cross-references,
 citations, footnotes, the table of contents and the lists of figures
 and tables, are also translated into hypertext links. Formatting
 information which has equivalent ``tags'' in HTML (lists, quotes,
 paragraph breaks, type styles, etc.) is also converted
 appropriately. The remaining heavily formatted items such as
 mathematical equations, pictures or tables are converted to images
 which are placed automatically at the correct positions in the final
 HTML document.
 .
 LaTeX2HTML extends LaTeX by supporting arbitrary hypertext links and
 symbolic cross-references between evolving remote documents. It also
 allows the specification of conditional text and the inclusion of raw
 HTML commands. These hypermedia extensions to LaTeX are available as
 new commands and environments from within a LaTeX document.
 .
 Pstoimg, the part of latex2html that produces bitmap images from the
 LaTeX source, can support both GIF and PNG format.

 you have started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit
 lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the transfers.
 It has also such nice features as reput and mirror. It can also download a
 file as soon as possible by using several connections at the same time.
 .
 Lftp can also be scriptable, it can be used to mirror sites, it lets you
 copy files among remote servers (even between FTP and HTTP). It has an
 extensive online help. It supports bookmarks, and connecting to several
 ftp/http sites at the same time.
 .

 excellent but not very well-known Algorithm::LCS module, with a drop-in
 interface identical to Algorithm::Diff.
 .
 Note that only the LCSidx function is optimized in XS at the moment, which
 means only compact_diff will get significantly faster for large data sets,
 while diff and sdiff will run in identical speed as Algorithm::Diff.

Description-md5: 24ecd848b7a3429afcfb05486a52c941
Description-en: Perl module for three-way merge of textual data
 Algorithm::Merge provides three-way merge and diff functions, complementing
 the functionality offered by Algorithm::Diff (libalgorithm-diff-perl). Given
 three sets of items, known as the original, left and right, this module can
 take a three-way difference or merge them. Taking a difference provides an
 array reference that is very similar to the behaviour of Algorithm::Diff. One
 can also implement custom conflict resolution using the CONFLICT callback.

 Apache2::Reload reloads modules that change on the disk.
 .
 When Perl pulls a file via "require", it stores the filename in the global
 hash %INC. The next time Perl tries to "require" the same file, it sees the
 file in %INC and does not reload from disk. This module's handler can be
 configured to iterate over the modules in %INC and reload those that have
 changed on disk. It can also monitor only specific modules that have
 registered themselves with Apache2::Reload. It is possible to trigger the
 check only when a special touch-file has been modified, minimizing the number
 of stat() calls per request.

Package: libautodie-perl
Description-md5: c8658a0874c1cd681f7cbe4fe17f699c
Description-en: Perl pragma to make certain failures fatal
 autodie is a Perl pragma that changes the behaviour of many built-in functions
 so that exceptions are thrown on failure rather than simply returning a false
 value. It understands lexical scope, meaning functions and subroutines altered
 with this module will only have this behaviour until the end of the enclosing
 eval, file or block, so it is useful when some code is out of your control.
 .
 By throwing exceptions on failure rather than simply returning false, programs
 are more robust and problems are easier to troubleshoot.
 .
 This module can also use IPC::System::Simple (see libipc-system-simple-perl)
 to do all the heavy lifting.

Description-en: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic
 duration class . Examples of time durations include days, minutes,
 seconds and nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number
 of clock ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are
 united with a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
 represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
 epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a
 particular platform: system_clock, steady_clock and
 high_resolution_clock. A clock is a pairing of a time_point and
 duration, and a function which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
 current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time
 spent by the current process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures
 system-CPU time spent by the current process.
  * A tuple-like class
 process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU, and system-CPU
 process times together.
  * A thread_clock thread steady clock giving
 the time spent by the current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Boost version (currently 1.54).

 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not

Description-en: regular expression library for C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

 Class::Name. For that, Class::Load provides "load_class 'Class::Name'".
 .
 It's often useful to test whether a module can be loaded, instead of throwing
 an error when it's not available. For that, Class::Load provides
 "try_load_class 'Class::Name'".
 .
 Finally, sometimes it is important to know whether a particular class has
 been loaded. Asking %INC is an option, but that will miss inner packages and
 any class for which the filename does not correspond to the package name. For
 that, this module provides "is_class_loaded 'Class::Name'".

 The Class::Singleton module implements a Singleton class from which other
 classes can be derived.  A Singleton describes an object class that can have
 only one instance in any system.  An example of a Singleton might be a print
 spooler or system registry.
 .
 By itself, the Class::Singleton module does very little other than manage the
 instantiation of a single object.  In deriving a class from Class::Singleton,
 your module will inherit the Singleton instantiation method and can implement
 whatever specific functionality is required.

 This is an Internet protocol suite Java library originally developed by
 ORO, Inc. This version supports Finger, Whois, TFTP, Telnet, POP3, FTP,
 NNTP, SMTP, and some miscellaneous protocols like Time and Echo as well
 as BSD R command support. The purpose of the library is to provide
 fundamental protocol access, not higher-level abstractions. Therefore,
 some of the design violates object-oriented design principles. Our
 philosophy is to make the global functionality of a protocal accesible
 (e.g., TFTP send file and receive file) when possible, but also provide
 access to the fundamental protocols where applicable so that the
 programmer may construct his own custom implementations (e.g, the TFTP
 packet classes and the TFTP packet send and receive methods are
 exposed). NetComponents was originally a commercial product, but after
 ORO dissolved, it was continued to be made available for those who
 found it useful. However, no updates have been made since version
 1.3.8, released in 1998. Now that certain contract obligations have
 expired, it is possible to make the source code freely available under

 DateTime is a Perl module which aims to provide a complete, correct, and easy
 to use date/time object implementation. It provides an easy way to manipulate
 dates and times, including date calculations (even addition and subtraction)
 and provides convenient methods for extracting or modifying portions of any
 date or time.
 .
 This module supports the Olson time zone database, meaning that historical
 time zone information, and more importantly, daylight saving time rules, can
 be handled transparently, simply by setting the correct time zone. This is
 done by using the DateTime::TimeZone module.

Package: libdatetime-timezone-perl
Description-md5: 49fff32146b7c0ac14d7bcca1f92bfe6
Description-en: framework exposing the Olson time zone database to Perl
 DateTime::TimeZone is a Perl module framework providing an interface to the
 Olson time zone database. It exposes the database as a set of modules, one
 for each time zone defined, allowing for various optimizations in doing time
 zone calculations.
 .
 The Olson time zone database is the best available source for worldwide time
 zone information and is available from <URL:ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/releases/>.

Description-en: Perl DBI driver with a self-contained RDBMS
 DBD::SQLite is a Perl DBI driver with a self-contained relational database
 management system. It embeds a small and fast embedded SQL database engine
 called SQLite (see sqlite3) into a DBI driver. It is useful if you want a
 relational database for your project, but don't want to install a large
 RDBMS system like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
 .
 SQLite supports the following features:
 .
  * Implements a large subset of SQL92 (<URL:http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html>)
  * A complete DB in a single disk file
    Everything for your database is stored in a single disk file, making it
    easier to move things around than with DBD::CSV.
  * Atomic commit and rollback
 .
 The engine is very fast, but for updates/inserts/dml it does perform a global
 lock on the entire database. This, obviously, might not be good for multiple
 user systems. The database also appears to be significantly faster if your
 transactions are coarse.

Package: libdevel-caller-perl
Description-md5: ad0dfe370ee7ed1b42895e16e40aafe8
Description-en: module providing enhanced caller() support
 Devel::Caller is a Perl module that provides several useful functions for
 introspecting your code deeper than the internal function "caller()" does. It
 allows you to access arguments passed to a function or even retrieve the code
 reference of the subroutine being invoked at the call frame indicated by the
 given level.

Package: libdevel-cover-perl
Description-md5: 14aa017ee7cc6570ae7dd3bfb556e39c
Description-en: Perl tool for determining code coverage metrics
 Devel::Cover is a Perl module that helps collect and display code coverage
 information. Code coverage information is collected using a pluggable runops
 function which counts how many times each op is executed. This data is then
 mapped back to reality using the B compiler modules. There is also a another
 statement profiler which needs a better backend to be really useful.
 .
 Statement, branch, condition, subroutine, pod and time coverage information is
 reported. Statement coverage data should be reasonable, although there may be
 some statements which are not reported. Branch and condition coverage data
 should be mostly accurate too, although not always what one might initially
 expect. Subroutine coverage should be as accurate as statement coverage. Pod
 coverage comes from Pod::Coverage. If Pod::Coverage::CountParents is available
 it will be used instead. Coverage data for path coverage are not yet
 collected.
 .
 The cover program can be used to generate coverage reports. Another included
 program, gcov2perl, can convert gcov files to Devel::Cover databases.

Package: libdist-checkconflicts-perl
Description-md5: 3ed68cbbfaa3fbc4f2e4e4db8290e3f7
Description-en: module for declaring version conflicts for a distribution
 One shortcoming of the CPAN clients that currently exist is that they have no
 way of specifying conflicting downstream dependencies of modules.
 Dist::CheckConflicts attempts to work around this issue by allowing you to
 specify conflicting versions of modules separately, and deal with them after
 the module is done installing.
 .
 For instance, say you have a module Foo, and some other module Bar uses Foo.
 If Foo were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would
 cause Bar to break until it is updated to use the new API. Foo can't just
 depend on the fixed version of Bar, because this will cause a circular
 dependency (because Bar is already depending on Foo), and this doesn't
 express intent properly anyway - Foo doesn't use Bar at all. The ideal
 solution would be for there to be a way to specify conflicting versions of
 modules in a way that would let CPAN clients update conflicting modules
 automatically after an existing module is upgraded, but until that happens,
 this module will allow users to do this manually.

Description-en: X11 Distributed Multihead library (debug package)
 libdmx is an interface to the DMX extension for X, which allows a single
 server to be set up as a proxy spanning multiple servers -- not unlike
 Xinerama across discrete physical machines.  It can be reconfigured
 on the fly to change the layout, and it is presented as a single logical
 display to clients.
 .
 libdmx allows clients to configure the layout of DMX servers by adding
 and removing screens, input devices, et al.
 .
 This package contains the debug versions of the library found in libdmx1.

Package: libencode-hanextra-perl
Description-md5: c9657081f76f7811fdc359b8cf30270d
Description-en: perl module providing extra sets of Chinese character encodings
 Perl 5.7.3 and later ships with an adequate set of Chinese encodings,
 including the commonly used CP950, CP936 (also known as GBK),
 Big5 (alias for Big5-Eten), Big5-HKSCS, EUC-CN, HZ, and
 ISO-IR-165. However, the numbers of Chinese encodings are staggering,
 and a complete coverage will easily increase the size of perl distribution
 by several megabytes; hence, this module tries to provide the rest of them.
 If you are using Perl 5.8 or later, Encode::CN and Encode::TW will
 automatically load the extra encodings for you, so there's no need to
 explicitly write "use Encode::HanExtra" if you are using one of them
 already.

Package: libencode-locale-perl
Description-md5: 56ab0dbfeb69a085703b46539790f388
Description-en: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

Package: libeval-closure-perl
Description-md5: e89014767dce167c131f30955893fe75
Description-en: Perl module to safely and cleanly create closures via string eval
 String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose
 uses it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors,
 which speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount. String eval is not
 without its issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in
 (which determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can
 be quite slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.
 .
 Eval::Closure attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides an
 eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other
 than a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the
 eval, so that doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a different
 environment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of
 the string to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if
 caching is to work properly).

 parser.  This means that you register handlers with the parser prior
 to starting the parse.  These handlers are called when the parser
 discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed.  A
 start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may
 register handlers.

Package: libexporter-lite-perl
Description-md5: c56451c6043a4eb8b5548b0cb5637ed6
Description-en: lightweight subset of Exporter
 Exporter::Lite is an alternative to Exporter intended to provide a
 lightweight subset of its functionality.  It supports import(), @EXPORT and
 @EXPORT_OK and not a whole lot else.
 .
 Unlike Exporter, it is not necessary to inherit from Exporter::Lite
 (ie. no @ISA = qw(Exporter::Lite) mantra).  Exporter::Lite simply
 exports its import() function.  This might be called a "mix-in".
 .
 Setting up a module to export its variables and functions is simple:
 .
 package My::Module;
 use Exporter::Lite;
 .
 @EXPORT = qw($Foo bar);

Package: libextutils-installpaths-perl
Description-md5: 05a1ecf4b53ddd0c54ea0336dfd5257d
Description-en: module to make Build.PL install path logic easy
 ExtUtils::InstallPaths tries to make install path resolution as easy as
 possible.
 .
 When you want to install a module, it needs to figure out where to install
 things. The nutshell version of how this works is that default installation
 locations are determined from ExtUtils::Config, and they may be individually
 overridden by using the install_path attribute. An install_base attribute
 lets you specify an alternative installation root like /home/foo and prefix
 does something similar in a rather different (and more complicated) way.
 destdir lets you specify a temporary installation directory like /tmp/install
 in case you want to create bundled-up installable packages.

Package: libfakeroot

 fakeroot provides a fake "root environment" by means of LD_PRELOAD and
 SysV IPC (or TCP) trickery. It puts wrappers around getuid(), chown(),
 stat(), and other file-manipulation functions, so that unprivileged
 users can (for instance) populate .deb archives with root-owned files;
 various build tools use fakeroot for this by default.
 .
 This package contains the LD_PRELOAD libraries.

Package: libfaketime
Description-md5: 9230deac6c49626e80400467f9098477
Description-en: report faked system time to programs
 The Fake Time Preload Library (FTPL, a.k.a. libfaketime) intercepts
 various system calls which programs use to retrieve the current date
 and time. It can then report faked dates and times (as specified by
 you, the user) to these programs. This means you can modify the
 system time a program sees without having to change the time
 system-wide. FTPL allows you to specify both absolute dates (e.g.,
 2004-01-01) and relative dates (e.g., 10 days ago).

 Flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. It reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. Flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled

 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

Description-en: free implementation of the OpenGL API -- GLX runtime
 Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to
 that of OpenGL.  To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command
 syntax or state machine, it is being used with authorization from
 Silicon Graphics, Inc.  However, the author makes no claim that Mesa
 is in any way a compatible replacement for OpenGL or associated with
 Silicon Graphics, Inc.
 .
 This version of Mesa provides GLX and DRI capabilities: it is capable of
 both direct and indirect rendering.  For direct rendering, it can use DRI
 modules from the libgl1-mesa-dri package to accelerate drawing.
 .
 This package does not include the modules themselves: these can be found
 in the libgl1-mesa-dri package.

Description-md5: 8481f3d0f0d4f49f42598ace739888b7
Description-en: C++ library for OpenGL GLSL type-based mathematics
 OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) is a header only C++ mathematics library for graphics
 software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specification.
 .
 GLM provides classes and functions designed and implemented with the same
 naming conventions and functionalities as GLSL, so that when a programmer
 knows GLSL, he knows GLM as well, which makes it really easy to use.
 .
 This project isn't limited to GLSL features. An extension system, based on the
 GLSL extension conventions, provides extended capabilities: matrix
 transformations, quaternions, half-based types, random numbers, et cetera.
 .
 This library works perfectly together with OpenGL but it also ensures
 interoperability with other third party libraries and SDKs. It is a good
 candidate for software rendering (such as raytracing, rasterisation), image
 processing, physic simulations and any context that requires a simple and
 convenient mathematics library.

Description-en: MIT Kerberos runtime libraries - krb5 GSS-API Mechanism
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").

 This module gives access to the routines of the GSSAPI library,
 as described in rfc2743 and rfc2744 and implemented by the
 Kerberos-1.2 distribution from MIT.
 .
 The API presented by this module is a mildly object oriented
 reinterpretation of the C API, where opaque C structures are
 Perl objects, but the style of function call has been left
 mostly untouched.  As a result, most routines modify one or
 more of the parameters passed to them, reflecting the C
 call-by-reference (or call-by-value-return) semantics.

 natural. It extends standard HTML with the pseudo tags <TMPL_VAR>,
 <TMPL_LOOP>, <TMPL_INCLUDE>, <TMPL_IF> and <TMPL_ELSE>. These are used
 to implement some basic logic - variable substitution, loops,
 conditional branches - inside the HTML template, while leaving the more
 complex computations to separate Perl code. This keeps the template
 accessible for designers and other non-Perl people, without limiting
 the programmer.

 Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both
 store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. For more
 information about cookies refer to
 <URL:http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html> and
 <URL:http://www.cookiecentral.com/>. HTTP::Cookies also implements the new
 style cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed
 to be able to coexist happily.
 .
 Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of

 initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a
 HTTP::Cookies object can be saved in and restored from files.

Package: libhttp-daemon-perl

 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::INET, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::INET subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

 use is error prone (when swoosh isn't defined, swoosh $x actually compiles to
 $x->swoosh).

 libio-socket-inet6-perl is installed.

Package: libio-string-perl
Description-md5: d0f30c36190caa285cda4e17606d2aa3
Description-en: Emulate IO::File interface for in-core strings
 The IO::String module provide the IO::File interface for in-core
 strings.  An IO::String object can be attached to a string, and
 will make it possible to use the normal file operations for reading or
 writing data, as well as seeking to various locations of the string.
 The main reason you might want to do this, is if you have some other
 library module that only provide an interface to file handles, and you
 want to keep all the stuff in memory.
 .
 The IO::String module provide an interface compatible with
 IO::File as distributed with IO-1.20, but the following methods
 are not available; new_from_fd, fdopen, format_write,
 format_page_number, format_lines_per_page, format_lines_left,
 format_name, format_top_name.

Package: libirman-dev
Description-md5: d9890e509cbe93a3714d8bc7e9193e80
Description-en: library for accessing the Irman Infra Red hardware
 libirman is a library that allows access to Irman Infra Red hardware from
 Linux and other Unix systems.
 .
 For general application programming, the preferred interface for infra-red
 control is `lirc', as lirc supports multiple programs sharing the same
 infra-red receiver.  It does this by providing a socket based interface to
 which several programs can connect.
 .
 lirc uses libirman to interface with the Irman Infra Red hardware, so in
 single use applications directly using libirman is simpler and uses less
 system resources.  Currently, lirc only works on Linux systems, so programs
 written using libirman directly are more portable.
 .
 NOTE: This debian package is mainly provided so that Irman support can be
 enabled in lirc package and there is no libirman0 because upstream doesn't
 build a shared library.

Description-en: jQuery plugin for parsing metadata from elements
 Sets the type of metadata to use. Metadata is encoded in JSON, and each
 property in the JSON will become a property of the element itself.
 .
 There are three supported types of metadata storage:
 .
   attr:  Inside an attribute. The name parameter indicates *which* attribute.
 .
   class: Inside the class attribute, wrapped in curly braces: { }
 .
   elem:  Inside a child element (e.g. a script tag). The name parameter
          indicates *which* element.
 .
 The metadata for an element is loaded the first time the element is accessed
 via jQuery.
 .
 As a result, you can define the metadata type, use $(expr) to load the metadata
 into the elements matched by expr, then redefine the metadata type and run
 another $(expr) for other elements.

Description-en: Perl port of the widely popular log4j logging package
 Log::Log4perl is a pure Perl port of the widely popular Apache/Jakarta
 log4j library for Java. In the spirit of log4j, Log::Log4perl
 addresses the shortcomings of typical ad-hoc or homegrown logging
 systems by providing three mechanisms to control the amount of data
 being logged and where it ends up at:
    * Levels allow you to specify the priority of log
      messages. Low-priority messages are suppressed when the system's
      setting allows for only higher-priority messages.
    * Categories define which parts of the system you want to enable
      logging in. Category inheritance allows you to elegantly reuse
      and override previously defined settings of different parts in the
      category hierarchy. So, at a central location in your system (either
      in a configuration file or in the startup code) you may specify which
      components (classes,functions) of your system should generate logs.
    * Appenders allow you to choose which output devices the log data
      is being written to, once it clears the previously listed
      hurdles.

Description-en: Logging library for java
 log4j is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of
 output targets.
 .
 It is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application
 binary. The log4j package is designed so that log statements can remain in
 shipped code without incurring a high performance cost.
 .
 One of the distinctive features of log4j is the notion of hierarchical
 loggers. Using loggers it is possible to selectively control which log
 statements are output at arbitrary granularity.
 .
 Log4j can output to: a file, a rolling file, a database with a JDBC driver,
 many output  asynchronously, a JMS Topic, a swing based logging console,
 the NT event log, /dev/null, a SMTP server (using javamail), a socket server,
 syslog, telnet daemon and stdout.

 The format of the output can be defined using one of the various layout
 (or user defined layout) like: simple text, html, date, pattern defined and
 XML.

Description-en: Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems - library
 The linear programming (LP) problem can be formulated as: Solve A.x >=
 V1, with V2.x maximal. A is a matrix, x is a vector of (nonnegative)
 variables, V1 is a vector called the right hand side, and V2 is a vector
 specifying the objective function.
 .
 An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the
 constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer
 linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer
 and others are real.
 .
 The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly
 more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying
 one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, <=, >= or =. The result
 specifies values for all variables.
 .
 lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for
 pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared
 integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound
 algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can
 read MPS format input files.
 .
 This package contains the static library for developing programs using
 liblpsolve.

 The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using HTTPS schemed URLs
 with LWP. LWP::Protocol::https is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so
 you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access
 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
 .
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

 Module::Build is a framework for easily building, testing and installing Perl
 packages. It is meant as a next-generation replacement for ExtUtils::MakeMaker
 and offers many additional features characteristic of a more modern install
 system, including simple subclassing for custom build actions.
 .
 Because it is written in Pure Perl, it has very few external dependencies. In
 particular, it allows for installation of packages on systems without 'make'
 and will even work without a shell. Its only prerequisites are modules that
 are included with perl 5.6.0 and it is core as of perl 5.10.

Package: libmoose-perl
Description-md5: cdb749f6802d04685cc71b5a7f9a5c87
Description-en: modern Perl object system framework
 Moose is an extension of the Perl 5 object system. The main goal of Moose is to
 make Perl 5 Object Oriented programming easier, more consistent, and less
 tedious. With Moose you can think more about what you want to do and less about
 the mechanics of OOP.
 .
 Additionally, Moose is built on top of Class::MOP, which is a metaclass system
 for Perl 5. This means that Moose not only makes building normal Perl 5 objects
 better, but it provides the power of metaclass programming as well.
 .
 Moose also conveniently manages all attributes (including inherited ones) that
 are defined, but also provides facilities for properly initializing instance
 slots, setting defaults where appropriate and performing any necessary type
 constraint checking or coercion.
 .
 More details about the structure of Moose as well as its features can be found
 in the ever-expanding Moose::Cookbook document.

Package: libnamespace-autoclean-perl
Description-md5: cc577199398ebdf3000ada0b769aeb4a
Description-en: module to remove imported symbols after compilation
 namespace::autoclean is a Perl pragma that keeps your namespace clean by
 removing all imported symbols at the end of the current package's compile
 cycle. Perhaps most importantly, this means that imported functions will no
 longer be made accidentally accessible to users outside of your package via
 method invocations.
 .
 This module differs from namespace::clean (see libnamespace-clean-perl) in
 that it cleans all imported functions, whether or not the imports happened
 prior to using the pragma. Things that "look" like a method (according to
 Class::MOP) will be left alone.

Package: libnamespace-clean-perl
Description-md5: 61ad33ea0d732ead09b6626ff8d86485
Description-en: module for keeping imports and functions out of the current namespace
 namespace::clean is a Perl pragma for keeping imported functions out of the
 current namespace. This is especially important because Perl functions are
 naturally available as methods, which can complicate subclassing.
 .
 Using the namespace::clean pragma will remove all previously declared or
 imported symbols at the end of the current package's compile cycle. This
 means that functions called in the package itself will still be bound by
 their name, but they won't show up as methods on your class or instances.

 file paths. It is friendlier to use than File::Spec and provides easy
 access to functions from several other core file handling modules.
 .
 It doesn't attempt to be as full-featured as IO::All or Path::Class,
 nor does it try to work for anything except Unix-like and Win32
 platforms.  Even then, it might break if you try something particularly
 obscure or tortuous. (Quick! What does this mean:
 "///../../..//./././a//b/.././c/././"? And how does it differ on
 Win32?)

Package: libppi-perl
Description-md5: 65e8ee936b1f6025105595702eb5063b
Description-en: module to parse, analyze and manipulate Perl code
 PPI provides the ability to parse, analyze and manipulate Perl code without
 actually executing the code, by implementing a lexer similar to what perl has
 itself internally.
 .
 The purpose of PPI is not to parse Perl Code, but to parse Perl Documents. By
 making this distinction and treating the problem this way, one could analyze
 files containing Perl source code in isolation from any other resources and
 without executing it, including other libraries. A significant feature of PPI
 is the ability to analyze Perl source code without requiring an instance of
 perl to run alongside or inside the parser.

 name with "PPIx::Utilities", e.g. functionality related to PPI::Nodes is in
 PPIx::Utilities::Node.

Description-en: protocol buffers C++ library (development files)
 Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
 serializing structured data - similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and
 simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
 use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
 data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
 You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
 that are compiled against the "old" format.
 .
 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats.

Description-en: pthread stubs not provided by native libc, development files
 This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided
 in libc or otherwise available by default.  Libraries like libxcb rely
 on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when
 linked to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running
 single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on
 platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.
 .
 On platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this
 package ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow
 libraries to unconditionally express a dependency on pthread-stubs and
 still obtain correct behavior.

Description-md5: b7b346189e6c11c18015c43e895af85e
Description-en: facility for creating read-only scalars, arrays and hashes
 Readonly is a facility for creating non-modifiable variables.
 This is useful for configuration files, headers, etc.
 It can also be useful as a development and debugging tool, for catching
 updates to variables that should not be changed.

Package: libreadonly-xs-perl
Description-md5: a248387b6edf9b1e3294d8e2e3f43945
Description-en: faster Readonly implementation
 The Readonly module (q.v.) is an effective way to create non-modifiable
 variables. However, it's relatively slow.
 .
 The reason it's slow is that is implements the read-only-ness of variables via
 tied objects. This mechanism is inherently slow. Perl simply has to do a lot
 of work under the hood to make tied variables work.
 .
 This module corrects the speed problem, at least with respect to scalar
 variables. When Readonly::XS is installed, Readonly uses it to access the
 internals of scalar variables. Instead of creating a scalar variable object
 and tying it, Readonly simply flips the SvREADONLY bit in the scalar's FLAGS
 structure.

Description-en: Reliable Event Logging Protocol (RELP) library - development files
 RELP provides reliable event logging over the network.
 .
 RELP (and hence) librelp assures that no message is lost, not even when
 connections break and a peer becomes unavailable. The current version of
 RELP has a minimal window of opportunity for message duplication after a
 session has been broken due to network problems. In this case, a few messages
 may be duplicated (a problem that also exists with plain tcp syslog). Future
 versions of RELP will address this shortcoming.
 .
 Please note that RELP is a general-purpose, extensible logging protocol. Even
 though it was designed to solve the urgent need of rsyslog-to-rsyslog
 communication, RELP supports many more applications. Extensible command verbs
 provide ample opportunity to extend the protocol without affecting existing
 applications.

Package: librole-tiny-perl
Description-md5: fe9c69a8e958a2d37cc15895cfa1bc6a
Description-en: Perl module for minimalist role composition
 Role::Tiny is a Perl module to do minimalist role composition. Role composition
 can be thought of as much more clever and meaningful multiple inheritance.
 .
 The basics of this implementation of roles is:
  * If a method is already defined on a class, that method will not be composed
    in from the role.
  * If a method that the role "requires" to be implemented is not implemented,
    role application will fail loudly.
 .
 Unlike Class::C3, where the last class inherited from "wins," role composition
 is the other way around, where first wins. In a more complete system (see
 Moose) roles are checked to see if they clash. The goal of this is to be much
 simpler, hence disallowing composition of multiple roles at once.

Package: libsub-exporter-perl
Description-md5: 831312c784e01c10890ab7865252448f
Description-en: sophisticated exporter for custom-built routines
 When you use a perl module, first it is "required" function used, then its
 import method is called.
 .
 Sub::Exporter provides a sophisticated alternative to Exporter.pm.  It allows
 for renaming, currying/sub-generation etc.
 .
 Sub::Exporter builds a custom exporter which can then be installed into your
 module. It builds this method based on configuration passed to its
 setup_exporter method.

Package: libsub-exporter-progressive-perl
Description-md5: 854d6f3825a72a536574faf14f5c2cdf
Description-en: module for using Sub::Exporter only if needed
 Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power comes
 great responsibility, as well as some runtime penalties.
 Sub::Exporter::Progressive is a Sub::Exporter wrapper that will let your
 users just use Exporter if all they are doing is picking exports, but use
 Sub::Exporter if your users try to use Sub::Exporter's more advanced
 features, like renaming exports.
 .
 Note that this module will export @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK package variables
 for Exporter to work. Additionally, if your package uses advanced
 Sub::Exporter features like currying, this module will only use
 Sub::Exporter, so you might as well use it directly.

Package: libsub-identify-perl
Description-md5: 2a26630b12f2def4d2231528d5f895f4
Description-en: Retrieve names of code references
 Sub::Identify allows you to retrieve the real name of code references. For
 this, it uses perl's introspection mechanism, provided by the B module.
 .
 It provides four functions : sub_name returns the name of the
 subroutine (or __ANON__ if it's an anonymous code reference),
 stash_name returns its package, and sub_fullname returns the
 concatenation of the two.
 .
 The fourth function, get_code_info, returns a list of two elements,
 the package and the subroutine name (in case of you want both and are worried
 by the speed.)
 .
 In case of subroutine aliasing, those functions always return the
 original name.

Package: libsub-install-perl
Description-md5: f75be2b1996502fcef46043ccd6316a5
Description-en: module for installing subroutines into packages easily

Package: libsub-name-perl
Description-md5: 4d3c396cd9ef5cce3647113eb96c42e3
Description-en: module for assigning a new name to referenced sub
 Sub::Name has only one function, which is also exported by default:
 .
 subname NAME, CODEREF
 .
 Assigns a new name to referenced sub. If package specification is
 omitted in the name, then the current package is used. The return
 value is the sub.
 .
 The name is only used for informative routines (caller, Carp, etc).
 You won't be able to actually invoke the sub by the given name. To
 allow that, you need to do glob-assignment yourself.

Package: libsub-uplevel-perl
Description-md5: c17fcb34119603f2d9fa587afe3444b8
Description-en: module to spoof the Perl call stack
 Sub::Uplevel is a Perl module that provides a safe implementation similar to
 Tcl's uplevel() function. It allows you to safely fool the caller() into
 thinking it's in a different part of the stack, without knowing that it is
 being wrapped.

Package: libtagcoll2-dev
Description-md5: 4f0bb748070edb127d52d61cbbb2702d
Description-en: Functions used to manipulate tagged collections (development version)
 Tagged collections are collections of items tagged with multiple categories.
 libtagcoll provides general infrastructure to handle tagged collection data,
 plus various kind of tagged collection manipulation functions:
 .
  * apply various kinds of transformations to the collection;
  * generate and apply tag patches;
  * discover and show implicit hierarchical relationships between
    tags;
  * organize the collection in an intuitively navigable hierarchy.
  * keep an on-disk index of the tag data
 .
 Warning: the API has not yet been stabilized and is subject to change in
 future versions.  This is why the library is distributed in a -dev package
 only.

Package: libtask-weaken-perl
Description-md5: fb54943f95a181df94f31285215fbe20
Description-en: module for ensuring that a platform has weaken support
 One recurring problem in modules that use Scalar::Util's weaken function is
 that it is not present in the pure-perl variant.
 .
 While this isn't necesarily always a problem in a straight CPAN-based Perl
 environment, some operating system distributions only include the pure-Perl
 versions, don't include the XS version, and so weaken is then "missing" from
 the platform, despite passing a dependency on Scalar::Util successfully.
 .
 The normal solution is to manually write tests in each distribution to ensure
 that weaken is available.
 .
 Task::Weaken restores the functionality testing to a dependency you do once
 in your Makefile.PL, rather than something you have to write extra tests for
 each time you write a module.

Package: libtest-deep-perl
Description-md5: 73cd5da785d054447b6e60a9c9aa4413
Description-en: Perl module for extremely flexible deep comparisons
 Test::Deep gives you very flexible ways to check that the result you got is
 the result you were expecting. At it's simplest it compares two structures by
 going through each level, ensuring that the values match, that arrays and
 hashes have the same elements and that references are blessed into the correct
 class. It also handles circular data structures without getting caught in an
 infinite loop.
 .
 Where it becomes more interesting is in allowing you to do something besides
 simple exact comparisons. With strings, the eq operator checks that 2 strings
 are exactly equal but sometimes that's not what you want. When you don't know
 exactly what the string should be but you do know some things about how it
 should look, eq is no good and you must use pattern matching instead.
 Test::Deep provides pattern matching for complex data structures

 Test::Exception is a Perl test module that provides a few convenience methods
 for testing exception-based code. It is built with Test::Builder and plays
 happily with Test::More and friends.
 .
 Note that this module only checks for exceptions, so it ignores other methods
 of halting program executing - including exit(). If your code causes the Perl
 interpreter to exit, Test::Exception won't be able to catch it.

Package: libtest-failwarnings-perl
Description-md5: 77cd849f7a135f071326c16cd46989d5

 Test::FailWarnings hooks $SIG{__WARN__} and converts warnings to Test::More's
 fail() calls. It is designed to be used with done_testing, when you don't
 need to know the test count in advance.
 .
 Just as with Test::NoWarnings, this does not catch warnings if other things
 localize $SIG{__WARN__}, as this is designed to catch unhandled warnings.

Package: libtest-leaktrace-perl
Description-md5: 44f7d84b31d908d4dea79804cb924f77
Description-en: Perl test module for tracing memory leaks
 Test::LeakTrace provides several functions that detect and trace memory leaks.
 This module scans arenas, the memory allocation system, so it can detect any
 leaked scalar values (SVs) in given blocks. Leaked SVs are those which are not
 released after the end of the scope they have been created, including internal
 caches and global variables.

Package: libtest-memory-cycle-perl
Description-md5: bd48d7e7c3d475b47b6b0c0a042e08bc
Description-en: Perl module that verifies code hasn't left circular references
 Test::Memory::Cycle checks for memory leaks and circular memory
 references. It's a thin Test::More-compatible wrapper around Lincoln
 Stein's Devel::Cycle module.
 .
 Perl's garbage collection has one big problem: Circular references
 can't get cleaned up. A circular reference can be as simple as two
 reference that refer to each other. Test::Memory::Cycle is built on
 top of Devel::Cycle to give you an easy way to check for these
 circular references. You can also use memory_cycle_exists() to make
 sure that you have a cycle where you expect to have one.

Package: libtest-minimumversion-perl
Description-md5: ba9a973e639952fee904f13b188ef7c6
Description-en: Perl test module to check the version of perl required
 Test::MinimumVersion is a simple test to look at the features you are using in
 your code and determine the minimum version of the perl interpreter that is
 required. This is helpful, for example, when you are using features like 'say'
 which was introduced in Perl 5.10.
 .
 This test makes it easy to determine if your Perl code requires a newer perl
 than expected, or if you accidentally made your dist require a newer version
 than strictly necessary.

Package: libtest-most-perl
Description-md5: 40af6726afd38f6494807dbcbfbaa73f
Description-en: Perl module with the most commonly needed test functions and features

 a bit more fine-grained control over your test suite.
 .
 All functions from the following modules will automatically be
 exported:
 .
  * Test::More
  * Test::Exception
  * Test::Differences
  * Test::Deep
  * Test::Warn
 .
 This is useful when one is used to most of the above modules but
 wouldn't want to bother to load them all explicitly.
 .
 Test::Most also provides a couple of routines to control tests
 behaviour in case of errors.

Package: libtest-nowarnings-perl
Description-md5: 73c551c227fb4e5ef1a4323629a4478e
Description-en: module to make sure you didn't emit any warnings while testing
 In general, your tests shouldn't produce warnings. This modules causes any
 warnings to be captured and stored. It automatically adds an extra test that
 will run when your script ends to check that there were no warnings. If there
 were any warings, the test will give a "not ok" and diagnostics of where, when
 and what the warning was, including a stack trace of what was going on when
 the it occurred.
 .
 If some of your tests are supposed to produce warnings then you should be
 capturing and checking them with Test::Warn, that way Test::NoWarnings will
 not see them and so not complain.
 .
 The test is run by an END block in Test::NoWarnings. It will not be run when
 any forked children exit.

Package: libtest-perl-critic-perl
Description-md5: f44c26cf50e4e4748610b16550770dd4
Description-en: module to use Perl::Critic in test scripts
 Test::Perl::Critic wraps the Perl::Critic engine in a convenient subroutine
 suitable for test programs written using the Test::More framework. This makes
 it easy to integrate coding-standards enforcement into the build process. For
 ultimate convenience (at the expense of some flexibility), see the criticism
 pragma.
 .
 If you'd like to try Perl::Critic without installing anything, there is a web
 service available at http://perlcritic.com. The web service does not support
 all the configuration features that are available in the native Perl::Critic
 API, but it should give you a good idea of what it does.

Package: libtest-pod-coverage-perl
Description-md5: db1ff4d31ce64c8535371572bdb66428
Description-en: Check for pod coverage in your distribution

Package: libtest-pod-perl
Description-md5: 6c5d646eddb2779b4d2bc7a579d696d2
Description-en: module to test for POD errors
 Test::Pod is a simple test for Perl's Plain Old Documentation (POD) format. It
 checks your distribution's module, script and documentation files for issues
 with the documentation syntax. In the CPAN community, it is considered a best
 practice to use this module as an author test prior to releasing your packages
 because it prevents issues with various applications that use the POD.

Package: libtest-requires-perl
Description-md5: 56c1024014b7e7a023b627711a2815bf
Description-en: utility module for tests to check whether modules are available

 simply checks to see if the module can be loaded. If loading the module fails
 then this skips all tests in the file, rather than causing a complete failure
 in module testing.

Package: libtest-script-perl
Description-md5: bbdb25e7172043f1175ad3d8a9aeea86
Description-en: Perl test module for scripts
 Test::Script is a Perl module that provides a series of basic tests for those
 files usually found in the bin or scripts directory of your package. It aims
 to provide your scripts with perfect platform-compatability and in a way that
 is as unobstrusive as possible. The general idea is that if a program works
 on a platform, then Test::Script tests should also pass on that platform.

Package: libtest-simple-perl
Description-md5: f67a3b225962298190eef6e2bef186a9
Description-en: set of basic utilities for writing tests in Perl

 modules and other pursuits.
 .
 This package also includes the following modules:
  * Test::Builder - backend for building test libraries
  * Test::Builder::Module - base class for test modules
  * Test::Builder::Tester - test testsuites that are built with Test::Builder
  * Test::Builder::Tester::Color - turn on colour in Test::Builder::Tester
  * Test::More - yet another framework for writing test scripts
 .
 This module is already included as part of Perl's core distribution, so this
 package is only beneficial when newer features or bug fixes are required.

Package: libtest-spelling-perl
Description-md5: 377937f9cfa3207a1cede619d04f9764
Description-en: Perl module for spellchecking pod formatted text
 Test::Spelling lets you check the spelling of a POD file, and report
 its results in standard Test::More fashion. This module requires a
 spellcheck program such as spell, aspell, ispell, or hunspell.
 .
 You can add your own stopwords, which are words that should be ignored by the
 spell check. See libpod-spell-perl (which this module is built upon) for a
 variety of ways to add per-file stopwords to each .pm file. If you have a lot
 of stopwords, it's useful to put them in your test file's DATA section.

Package: libtest-strict-perl
Description-md5: 6be5adbf6c1ac10eff20dd7f0d8527a7
Description-en: test module for checking the syntax of use strict and test coverage
 Test::Strict tests if the code compiles and inter-operates with
 Test::Simple modules. Another good practice this module can test
 is to "use strict;" in all perl files.
 .
 By setting a minimum test coverage through all_cover_ok(), a code
 author can ensure his code is tested above a preset level of kwalitee
 (CPAN quality metrics) throughout the development cycle. Along with
 Test::Pod, this module can provide the first tests to setup for a
 module author.

 specific number of times. It is useful in situations like testing caching
 code, where you want to do some tests as normal and then verify that some
 underlying subroutine within the code was called a specific number of times.

Package: libtest-synopsis-perl
Description-md5: c012198048183ab89ee79b78a9e690e7
Description-en: Perl module to test SYNOPSIS code in PODs
 Test::Synopsis is an (author) test module to find .pm or .pod files
 under your lib directory and then make sure the example snippet code in
 your SYNOPSIS section passes the perl compile check.
 .
 Note that this module only checks the perl syntax (by wrapping the code
 with sub) and doesn't actually run the code.

 Tainted data is data that comes from an unsafe source, such as the
 command line, or, in the case of web apps, any GET or POST transactions.
 Read the perlsec man page for details on why tainted data is bad,
 and how to untaint the data.
 .
 When you're writing unit tests for code that deals with tainted data,
 you'll want to have a way to provide tainted data for your routines to
 handle, and easy ways to check and report on the taintedness of your data,
 in standard Test::More style.

Package: libtest-tester-perl
Description-md5: b9a4f9560a3c9c804b5b34e028b74a4a

 programs and replace them with their values.

Package: libtext-unidecode-perl
Description-md5: ebd84afefc973c032d303a02e6e5b156
Description-en: Text::Unidecode -- US-ASCII transliterations of Unicode text
 It often happens that you have non-Roman text data in Unicode, but
 you can't display it -- usually because you're trying to
 show it to a user via an application that doesn't support Unicode,
 or because the fonts you need aren't accessible.  You could
 represent the Unicode characters as "???????" or
 "\15BA\15A0\1610...", but that's nearly useless to the user who
 actually wants to read what the text says.
 .
 What Text::Unidecode provides is a function, unidecode(...) that
 takes Unicode data and tries to represent it in US-ASCII characters
 (i.e., the universally displayable characters between 0x00 and
 0x7F).  The representation is
 almost always an attempt at transliteration -- i.e., conveying,
 in Roman letters, the pronunciation expressed by the text in
 some other writing system.  (See the example in the synopsis.)

Description-en: X C Binding, debugging symbols
 This package contains the debugging symbols associated with libxcb, the X C
 Binding.  gdb will automatically use these symbols when debugging libxcb.
 .
 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
 designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description-en: X cursor management library
 Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the
 X Window System.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in
 several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
 images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.

  * eXtensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 Second Edition Recommendation
  * Namespaces in XML Recommendation
  * Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core, Events, and Traversal and
    Range Recommendations
  * Simple API for XML (SAX) 2.0.1 Core and Extension
  * Java APIs for XML Processing (JAXP) 1.2.01

 Candidate Recommendation, except that it does not yet provide an option to
 enable normalization checking as described in section 2.13 of this
 specification. It also handles namespaces according to the  XML Namespaces 1.1
 Candidate Recommendation, and will correctly serialize XML 1.1 documents if
 the DOM level 3 load/save API's are in use.

Description-en: Perl module for putting all characters into a single event
 The XML::Filter::BufferText module is a very simple filter.  One common
 cause of grief (and programmer error) is that XML parsers aren't required
 to provide character events in one chunk.  They can, but are not forced
 to, and most don't.  This filter does the trivial but oft-repeated task
 of putting all characters into a single event.

Package: libxml-parser-perl
Description-md5: f3f996bbf5ff035cbc02bffeda96694b
Description-en: Perl module for parsing XML files
 XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on top
 of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James
 Clark's expat library.  Each call to one of the parsing methods
 creates a new instance of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to
 parse the document.  Expat options may be provided when the
 XML::Parser object is created.  These options are then passed on to
 the Expat object on each parse call.  They can also be given as extra
 arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or
 Handlers options, or by setHandlers method.  These all provide
 mechanisms for XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by
 XML::Parser::Expat.  If neither Style nor Handlers are specified,
 then parsing just checks the document for being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first
 parameter the Expat object, not the Parser object.

Package: libxml-sax-base-perl
Description-md5: d2b9fd04fe2bfb32b35febb80f2cfc34
Description-en: base class for SAX drivers and filters
 XML::SAX::Base is a base class for PerlSAX drivers and filters.  The main
 advantages that it provides are easy dispatching of events the right way (ie
 it takes care for you of checking that the handler has implemented that
 method, or has defined an AUTOLOAD), and the guarantee that filters will pass
 along events that they aren't implementing to handlers downstream that might
 nevertheless be interested in them.
 .
 This package also provides XML::SAX::Exception.

Description-en: Perl module for a SAX2 driver for Expat (XML::Parser)
 This module is an implementation of a SAX2 driver sitting on top of
 Expat (XML::Parser).  It is still incomplete, though most of the
 basic SAX2 events should be available.

Package: libxml-sax-perl
Description-md5: 85b6ca7554a3537b49500d73d818d9b6
Description-en: Perl module for using and building Perl SAX2 XML processors
 XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and
 building Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers.  It is designed
 around the need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an
 application without requiring programmer intervention.  Those of you
 familiar with the DBI will be right at home.  Some of the designs
 come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the
 javaness.
 .
 The package also contains a SAX parser, XML::SAX::PurePerl, but it
 is considered too slow for serious use and is only provided as a
 fallback parser. It is recommend XML::SAX::Expat (provided in
 libxml-sax-expat-perl) instead.
 .
 The framework includes a Debian-specific script (called
 update-perl-sax-parsers) to manage the ParserDetails.ini file. This
 script is intended to be used in postinst and prerm package scripts to
 (de)register parsers.  See README.Debian for more info.

Package: libxml-sax-writer-perl

 XML::SAX::Writer helps to serialize SAX2 representations of XML documents to
 strings, files, and other flat representations. It handles charset encodings,
 XML escaping conventions, and so forth. It is still considered alpha,
 although it has been put to limited use in settings such as XML::LibXML and
 the AxKit XML Application Server.

Package: libxml-simple-perl
Description-md5: 9205d4b838f0b9ba0b4731da4e97a76d
Description-en: Perl module for reading and writing XML
 The XML::Simple module provides a simple API layer on top of an underlying
 XML parsing module to maintain XML files (especially configuration
 files).  Two functions are exported: XMLin() and XMLout().
 .
 The simplest approach is to call these two functions directly, but an
 optional object oriented interface allows them to be called as
 methods of an XML::Simple object.  The object interface can also be
 used at either end of a SAX pipeline.

Description-en: New XML object model for Java
 XOM(tm) is a new XML object model. It is an open source (LGPL),
 tree-based API for processing XML with Java that strives for correctness,
 simplicity, and performance, in that order.
 .
 XOM is designed to be easy to learn and easy to use. It works very
 straight-forwardly, and has a very shallow learning curve. Assuming
 you're already familiar with XML, you should be able to get up and
 running with XOM very quickly.
 .
 XOM is the only XML API that makes no compromises on correctness.
 XOM only accepts namespace well-formed XML documents, and only allows
 you to create namespace well-formed XML documents. (In fact, it's a
 little stricter than that: it actually guarantees that all documents
 are round-trippable and have well-defined XML infosets.) XOM manages
 your XML so you don't have to. With XOM, you can focus on the unique
 value of your application, and trust XOM to get the XML right.

 support the YAML 1.1 specification. The provided Dump and Load routines
 are compatible with the Perl YAML module (see libyaml-perl).

 YAML is a generic data serialization language that is optimized for human
 readability. It can be used to express the data structures of most modern
 programming languages (including Perl, of course). YAML supports Unicode
 and there are implementations of the parser in many different languages,
 making it a rather portable serialization format.
 .
 Please note that the YAML module is currently a deprecated implementation
 in Pure Perl, which is probably slow on your system. The authors intend
 to change it to just be a front-end interface module for various YAML
 implementations. For now, YAML::Any is a module provided for this purpose,
 which simply selects the best YAML implementation available.

Package: lintian
Description-md5: 4a295ed43917ad13b4ca23bd39814dba
Description-en: Debian package checker
 Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy
 violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian
 policy as well as some checks for common errors.
 .
 It uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which it stores
 information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this
 information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
 expensive data-collection operations. This makes it possible to check the
 complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
 .
 This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian
 packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
 should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
 archive.
 .
 This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 3.9.5.

 LinuxDoc sgml is a highly configurable text format for writing
 documentation, something like html only it's simpler and can be
 converted to various other formats, including html for websites.
 You write a LinuxDoc document using any text editor such as vim.
 Then you use linuxdoc-tools to convert it to html, rtf, plain-text
 (install linuxdoc-tools-text), info (install linuxdoc-tools-info),
 LaTeX, dvi or postscript (install linuxdoc-tools-latex). The
 sgmltools-lite package can convert LinuxDoc to DocBook format.

Package: llvm-3.4
Description-md5: 9e5c5554d1a5882101129d5527e3e617
Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC or many other architectures.
 .
 LLVM is the key component of the clang compiler and the gcc plugin called
 dragonegg.

Package: logrotate
Description-md5: bb73169bb75b2b8a2fda1453d214416d
Description-en: Log rotation utility
 The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration of
 log files on a system which generates a lot of log files.  Logrotate
 allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal and mailing of
 log files.  Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly,
 monthly or when the log file gets to a certain size.  Normally, logrotate
 runs as a daily cron job.

Package: logtail
Description-md5: a844125a20d0a40064a9bb3cc49d8c48
Description-en: Print log file lines that have not been read (deprecated)
 This program will read in a standard text file and create an
 offset marker when it reads the end. The offset marker is read
 the next time logtail is run and the text file pointer is moved
 to the offset location. This allows logtail to read in the next
 lines of data following the marker. This is good for marking log
 files for automatic log file checkers to monitor system events.
 .
 The package also provides logtail2, which better deals with rotated log
 files: If logtail2 finds that the inode of the file was changed, it assumes
 that the log has been rotated, and tries to find the file it was rotated to
 using heuristic plugins. If it finds the file, it will print the remainder of
 the file starting at the offset saved to the offset file. If a file with the
 correct inode was not found, logtail2 will only print the new file in its
 entirety before writing a new offset file.

Package: logwatch
Description-md5: ece539a8a87c5f861d7f0b865e42a03c
Description-en: log analyser with nice output written in Perl
 Logwatch is a modular log analyser that runs every night
 and mails you the results. It can also be run from command line.
 .
 The output is by service and you can limit the output to one particular
 service. The subscripts which are responsible for the output, mostly
 convert the raw log lines in structured format.
 .
 Logwatch generally ignores the time component in the output, that means,
 you will know that the reported event was logged in the requested range of
 time, but you will have to go to the raw log files to get the exact details.

Package: lp-solve
Description-md5: bc9fbd53b2b145f26b30729410336710
Description-en: Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems
 The linear programming (LP) problem can be formulated as: Solve A.x >=
 V1, with V2.x maximal. A is a matrix, x is a vector of (nonnegative)
 variables, V1 is a vector called the right hand side, and V2 is a vector
 specifying the objective function.
 .
 An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the
 constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer
 linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer
 and others are real.
 .
 The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly
 more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying
 one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, <=, >= or =. The result
 specifies values for all variables.
 .
 lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for
 pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared
 integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound
 algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can
 read MPS format input files.

 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can

 .
 This package contains nothing else than a fake /usr/sbin/sendmail
 command to fulfill the LSB's requirement of providing this command without
 requiring an MTA to get installed, which once introduces a daemon which
 can cause security problems and second, users get asked questions about
 how they want their MTA configured when in reality they simply wanted to
 install a desktop application or a printer driver, but the dependency on
 LSB compliance pulls in an MTA with the installation.
 .
 The LSB requirement on /usr/sbin/sendmail comes from old times where Linux
 and Unix machines had all fixed IPs and did server tasks in data centers.
 Today's typical desktop Linux machines do not do local e-mail any more as
 users use external e-mail services.
 .
 The /usr/sbin/sendmail always exits with exit status -1 (255) and sends a
 warning message to stderr, so that if a program actually tries to send e-mail
 via the sendmail command the user gets note.

Description-en: Tracks runtime library calls in dynamically linked programs
 ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command until it
 exits.  While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and records
 the dynamic library calls which are called by
 the executed process and the signals received by that process.
 It can also intercept and print the system calls executed by the program.
 .
 The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
 use it on binaries for which you don't have the source handy.

Package: memcached
Description-md5: c96e946324d6d6114d0daad2388780d3
Description-en: A high-performance memory object caching system
 Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com,
 a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1
 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers.
 memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page
 load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the
 databases on a memcache miss.
 .
 memcached optimizes specific high-load serving applications that are designed
 to take advantage of its versatile no-locking memory access system. Clients
 are available in several different programming languages, to suit the needs
 of the specific application. Traditionally this has been used in mod_perl
 apps to avoid storing large chunks of data in Apache memory, and to share
 this burden across several machines.

 boot-up, so that it can test *all* of your memory.  You may want to
 look at `memtester', which allows to test your memory within Linux,
 but this one won't be able to test your whole RAM.
 .
 It can output a list of bad RAM regions usable by the BadRAM kernel
 patch, so that you can still use your old RAM with one or two bad bits.
 .
 Memtest86+ is based on memtest86 3.0, and adds support for recent
 hardware, as well as a number of general-purpose improvements,
 including many patches to memtest86 available from various sources.
 .
 Both memtest86 and memtest86+ are being worked on in parallel.

Package: mksh
Description-md5: dbb9cd4655763bf0804c90898b9feac0
Description-en: MirBSD Korn Shell
 mksh is the successor of the Public Domain Korn shell (pdksh),
 a Bourne/POSIX compatible shell which is largely similar to the
 original AT&T Korn Shell (ksh88/ksh93).
 It includes bug fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a
 modern, robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
 mksh has UTF-8 support (in string operations and the Emacs editing
 mode). The code has been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed,
 standards compliance added, and several enhancements (for extended
 compatibility to other modern shells, as well as a couple of its
 own) are available.
 This shell is Debian Policy 10.4 compliant and may be used as /bin/sh
 on Debian systems (if udev is installed, /bin/lksh should be used;
 otherwise, both /bin/mksh-static and /bin/mksh flavours also work),
 and as rescue and initrd shell (/bin/mksh-static especially).
 .
 The mksh-static binary is a version of mksh, linked against klibc or
 dietlibc (if they exist for that Debian architecture and are usable)
 and optimised for small code size, for example for use on initrd or
 initramfs images, installation or rescue systems, or /bin/sh on slow
 architectures.
 It omits some leaf features to be even smaller.
 .
 The lksh binary is a script shell based on mksh intended to run old
 ksh88 and pdksh scripts, but not for interactive use.
 .
 A sample ~/.mkshrc is included in /usr/share/doc/mksh/examples and
 provided as /etc/mkshrc conffile, which is sourced by another file
 /etc/skel/.mkshrc users are recommended to copy into their home.

Package: mlocate
Description-md5: 34e9c00f37885dbcdfb61296f24c84df
Description-en: quickly find files on the filesystem based on their name
 mlocate is a new implementation of locate, a tool to find files
 anywhere in the filesystem based on their name, using a fixed pattern
 or a regular expression. Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses
 a previously created database to perform the search, allowing queries
 to execute much faster. This database is updated periodically from
 cron.
 .
 Several implementations of locate exist: the original implementation
 from GNU's findutils, slocate, and mlocate. The advantages of mlocate
 are:
 .
  * it indexes all the filesystem, but results of a search will only
    include files that the user running locate has access to. It does
    this by updating the database as root, but making it unreadable for
    normal users, who can only access it via the locate binary. slocate
    does this as well, but not the original locate.
 .
  * instead of re-reading all the contents of all directories each time
    the database is updated, mlocate keeps timestamp information in its
    database and can know if the contents of a directory changed without
    reading them again. This makes updates much faster and less demanding
    on the hard drive. This feature is only found in mlocate.
 .
 Installing mlocate will change the /usr/bin/locate binary to point to
 mlocate via the alternatives mechanism. After installation, you may
 wish to run /etc/cron.daily/mlocate by hand to create the database,
 otherwise mlocate won't work until that script is run from cron itself
 (since mlocate does not use the same database file as standard locate).
 Also, you may wish to remove the "locate" package in order not to have
 two different database files updated regularly on your system.

Description-en: ML language implementation with a class-based object system
 Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language, based on
 the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
 and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.
 .
 OCaml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode
 which is then interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly,
 generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is
 portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of
 generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation:
 almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used
 either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces
 standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based system.
 .
 The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number
 of processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but
 the generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining
 the moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. It is not
 available on all arches though.
 .
 This package contains everything needed to develop OCaml applications,
 including the graphics libraries.

 Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language, based on
 the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
 and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.
 .
 OCaml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode
 which is then interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly,
 generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is
 portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of
 generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation:
 almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used
 either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces
 standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based system.
 .
 The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number
 of processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but
 the generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining
 the moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. It is not
 available on all arches though.
 .
 This package contains everything needed to develop OCaml applications
 that do not require the graphics library.

Package: pax
Description-md5: 7f236f6351e1536c2153e84c93563932
Description-en: Portable Archive Interchange (cpio, pax, tar)
 paxtar is an implementation of an archiving utility that reads
 and writes several formats - traditional ones, the extended
 formats specified in IEEE 1003.1, and the ar(5) format used
 by deb(5) packages (MirBSD specific paxtar extension). The
 pax interface was designed by IEEE 1003.2 as a compromise in
 the chronic controversy over which of tar or cpio is best, but
 this implementation offers paxcpio and paxtar for easy calling.
 .
 This is the MirBSD paxtar implementation supporting the formats
 ar, bcpio, cpio, SVR4 cpio with and without CRC, old tar, and
 ustar, but not the format known as pax yet. It has extensions
 for removing non-numerical user and group IDs from the archive,
 storing hardlinked files only once, setting ownership to the
 superuser, anonymising inode and device information, changing
 the mtime to zero, and producing GNU tar compatible trailing
 slashes on ustar directory nodes. Its "ar" format is suitable
 for operating on *.deb files, unlike that of GNU binutils.
 .
 Note that ACLs and Extended Attributes are not supported.
 Also, on Debian GNU/Hurd and Debian GNU/Linux (but not
 Debian GNU/kFreeBSD), size of archive members is limited
 to the width of the "long" type, that is, 2 GiB on platforms
 that do not have a 64-bit "long" type, due to a bug in the
 GNU C library (Debian #317466).

 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.

 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the GTK+ tool kit version 2, so it is especially suitable for
 users of GNOME.  If the X Window System is not active then an
 alternative text-mode dialog will be used.  There are sibling packages
 that implement PIN entry dialogs using other tool kits.

  - debhelper build system (--buildsystem=kde) and dh addon (--with kde) for
    building packages based on the KDE Platform;
  - dh_sameversiondep for generating a dependency that is versioned the same
    way as a dependency (coming from the same source) of another reference
    package.
  - dh_movelibkdeinit for moving libkdeinit4_*.so libraries to private
    location;
  - dh_sodeps (and sodeps dh addon) for generating so:Depends substvar for -dev
    packages based to which local packages lib*.so symlinks point to;
  - pkgkde-symbolshelper tool for efficient management of C and C++ symbol
    files;
  - pkgkde-debs2symbols tool for generating symbol files and symbol file
    patches from pre-built binaries in the deb packages;
  - pkgkde-getbuildlogs tool for downloading build logs for the specified
    package (from buildd.debian.org);
  - pkgkde-override-sc-dev-latest tool for overriding Breaks of the
    kde-sc-dev-latest package;
  - pkgkde-vcs tool for performing common tasks when packaging under VCS.

 from generated binary packages, because translations are already shipped
 in the language packs.  Its behaviour (which is disabled by default) is
 configured in /etc/pkgbinarymangler/striptranslations.conf.
 .
 pkgmaintainermangler adjusts the maintainer field in binary packages to
 match a set of rules (including whitelists, mass renames by component,

 PlainBox is a toolkit consisting of python3 library, development tools,
 documentation and examples. It is targeted at developers working on testing or
 certification applications and authors creating tests for such applications.
 .
 PlainBox can be used to both create simple and comprehensive test tools as
 well as to develop and execute test jobs and test scenarios. It was created as
 a refined and rewritten core of the Checkbox project. It has a well tested and
 documented core, small but active development community and a collection of
 associated projects that use it as a lower-level engine/back-end library.
 .
 PlainBox has a novel approach to discovering (and probing) hardware and
 software that is extensible and not hardwired into the system. It allows test
 developers to express association between a particular test and the hardware,
 software and configuration constraints that must be met for the test to
 execute meaningfully. This feature, along with pluggable test definitions,
 makes plainbox flexible and applicable to many diverse testing situations,
 ranging from mobile phones, traditional desktop computers, servers and up to
 testing "cloud" installations.
 .
 This package contains a PolicyKit .policy file that allows PlainBox to run
 plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 as root and ask for the user password only once
 per session.

 to run common actions without being asked for their password:
 .
  * mounting and checking internal disk drives (through udisks)
  * setting the CPU speed and policy (through the GNOME CPU frequency applet)
  * setting the time and timezone (through the GNOME clock applet or through
    KDE)
  * Adding/changing system-wide NetworkManager connections
  * Update already installed software
  * Configure printers
 .
 It does not change privileges for non-Administrators (users who are not in the
 "admin" or "sudo" group). So this satisfies the typical desktop/laptop use
 case where the user has full control over the hardware anyway.
 .
 This is implemented by shipping a pklocalauthority(8) file.

Package: policyrcd-script-zg2
Description-md5: b8bbba679a71741ca48177c13074bc32
Description-en: policy-compliant interface from invoke-rc.d to local config files
 a script which is linked via the alternatives subsystem to
 /usr/sbin/update-rc.d. This script looks for a local policy-rc.d
 script in /usr/local and /etc, providing a policy- and FHS-compliant
 way to interface invoke-rc.d with a local script.
 .
 Without this package, a local admin wanting to cleanly interface with
 invoke-rc.d is forced to drop a local binary to /usr/sbin and/or
 manually interface with the alternatives system. Both ways of doing
 this are clumsy and error-prone, so this package offers a clean way of
 interfacing with sysvrc and file-rc.
 .
 Since there are at least two packages containing their own version of
 invoke-rc.d, having a search path policy for policy-rc.d can be
 messy and is prone to be unstructured and uncoordinated.
 .
 Hence, having a dedicated package is the clean way of doing things.
 .
 This package has its upstream sources maintained in the Debian
 project, so there is no upstream URL.

 ps2eps is a tool to produce Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS/EPSF)
 from usual one-paged Postscript documents. It calculates correct
 Bounding Boxes for those EPS files and filters some special
 postscript command sequences that can produce erroneous results on
 printers.  EPS files are needed for including (scalable) graphics
 into TeX (or even Word) documents.  Other programs like ps2epsi do
 not calculate the bounding box always correctly (because the values are
 put on the PostScript stack which may get corrupted by bad PostScript
 code) or rounded it off so that clipping the EPS cut off some parts of
 the image. Therefore ps2eps uses a resolution of 144 dpi to get the
 correct bounding box.

Description-en: Python web development framework - version 3
 CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented web development framework. It
 provides the foundation over which complex web-based applications can
 be written, with little or no knowledge of the underlying
 protocols. CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in
 much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python
 program. This usually results in smaller source code developed in
 less time.
 .
 CherryPy is up-to-date with the latest developments on using Python
 for web development: it features a bundled WSGI server, and is able
 to integrate with other dispatching mechanisms, such as
 Routes. CherryPy can be run as a standalone application, since it
 provides its own HTTP server; setting it up behind another HTTP
 server, such as Apache, or even with mod_python are also options.
 .
 This version is backwards incompatible with the 2.2 version in some
 ways. See http://www.cherrypy.org/wiki/UpgradeTo30.

Package: python-egenix-mxdatetime
Description-md5: e3102cb577c19b97097313b6b22ad8ea
Description-en: date and time handling routines for Python
 mxDateTime is a Python extension package that provides three new
 objects, DateTime, DateTimeDelta and RelativeDateTime, which let you
 store and handle date/time values in a much more natural way than by
 using ticks (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), the representation
 used by Python's time module).
 .
 You can add, subtract and even multiply instances, pickle and copy
 them and convert the results to strings, COM dates, ticks and some
 other more esoteric values. In addition, there are several convenient
 constructors and formatters at hand to greatly simplify dealing with
 dates and times in real-world applications.
 .
 In addition to providing an easy-to-use Python interface the package
 also exports a comfortable C API interface for other extensions to
 build upon. This is especially interesting for database applications
 which often have to deal with date/time values (the mxODBC package is
 one example of an extension using this interface).
 .
 mxDateTime can convert between various different date/time storage
 formats, including COM dates, TJD, MJD, JDN, tuples and, probably
 most important, strings.
 .
 The date/time parser included in mxDateTime is one of the most
 flexible such parser available for Python. It is constantly being
 improved to make parsing date/time strings as easy as possible. At
 the same time, it offers a fully customizable interface which allows
 selecting valid date/time formats from a range of predefined
 categories.
 .
 There are also special parser and formatter modules for ARPA and ISO
 date/time formats, which are handy if you work a lot with Internet
 standards.

 Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django
 inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional

 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] with a method to perform partial
 modifications to resources.
 .
 JSON Patch is a format (identified by the media type "application/
 json-patch") for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a target JSON
 document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method.

Description-md5: 88ebc1646dbd25b8c4e5cd265730c872
Description-en: resolve JSON pointers - python 2.x
 Python-json-pointer is a small library to resolve JSON pointers according to
 the IETF draft specification. JSON Pointer defines a string syntax for
 identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
 document.
 .
 This package provides the module for Python 2.x.

Package: python-jsonpatch
Description-md5: dfb83c7e2938da703b78efb58a27f76a
Description-en: library to apply JSON patches - python 2.x
 Python-json-patch is a Python module (a library) to apply JSON Patches
 according to the IETF draft specification.
 .
 From the IETF site:
 .
 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] is a common format for the
 exchange and storage of structured data.  HTTP PATCH [RFC5789] extends the
 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] with a method to perform partial
 modifications to resources.
 .
 JSON Patch is a format (identified by the media type "application/
 json-patch") for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a target JSON
 document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method.
 .
 This format is also potentially useful in other cases when it's necessary to
 make partial updates to a JSON document.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.x module.

Package: python-jsonpath-rw
Description-md5: 8c3c26a7ca91a4c152b759e0cd5c4b87
Description-en: extended implementation of JSONPath for Python 2.x
 This library provides a robust and significantly extended implementation of
 JSONPath for Python. It is tested with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3.
 .
 This library differs from other JSONPath implementations in that it is a full
 language implementation, meaning the JSONPath expressions are first class
 objects, easy to analyze, transform, parse, print, and extend.
 .
 The JSONPath syntax supported by this library includes some additional
 features and omits some problematic features (those that make it unportable).
 In particular, some new operators such as "|" and "where" are available, and
 parentheses are used for grouping not for callbacks into Python, since with
 these changes the language is not trivially associative. Also, fields may be
 quoted whether or not they are contained in brackets.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.x module.

Package: python-jsonrpclib
Description-md5: df1059d39ea649b629d8d90d579fb364

 Python. It is designed to be as compatible with the syntax of xmlrpclib as
 possible (it extends where possible), so that projects using xmlrpclib could
 easily be modified to use JSON and experiment with the differences.
 .
 It is backwards-compatible with the 1.0 specification, and supports all of the
 new proposed features of 2.0, including:
  * Batch submission (via MultiCall)
  * Keyword arguments
  * Notifications (both in a batch and 'normal')
  * Class translation using the 'jsonclass' key.

Description-en: inject useful and sensible default behaviors into setuptools - Python 2.x
 PBR (Python Build Reasonableness) is a library that injects some useful and
 sensible default behaviors into your setuptools run. PBR can:
  * Manage version number bad on git revisions and tags (Version file).
  * Generate AUTHORS file from git log
  * Generate ChangeLog from git log
  * Generate Sphinx autodoc stub files for your whole module
  * Store your dependencies in a pip requirements file
  * Use your README file as a long_description
  * Smartly find packages under your root package
 .
 PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent way
 to run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because then it's
 simple and repeatable. If you want to do things differently, cool! But you've
 already got the power of Python at your fingertips, so you don't really need
 PBR.
 .

Package: python-scour
Description-md5: 054ddc9b48c7ae0399c1ae1fcbad37cf
Description-en: SVG scrubber and optimizer
 Scour is a Python module that aggressively cleans SVG files, removing a lot of
 unnecessary information that certain tools or authors embed into their
 documents.  The goal of scour is to provide an identically rendered image
 (i.e. a scoured document should have no discernable visible differences from
 the original file) while minimizing the file size.
 .
 WARNING: Scour is intended to be run on files that have been edited in Vector
 Graphics editors such as Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.  Scour attempts to
 optimize the file, and as result, it will change the file's structure and
 (possibly) its semantics.  If you have hand-edited your SVG files, you will
 probably not be happy with the output of Scour.
 .
 Never use scour to overwrite your original file!
 .
 This package also provides a dh_scour debhelper extension which optimizes all
 shipped SVGs during package build. If python-rsvg and python-cairo are
 available, it will also do a before/after comparison and discard the optimized
 image if they differ by more than 0.05%.

  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Package: python-swift
Description-md5: de070055ceecd087c69ec8d278884c43
Description-en: distributed virtual object store - Python libraries
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides the Python libraries that actually implement
 everything.

Description-en: Web Services Made Easy makes it easy to implement multi-protocol webservices
 Web Service Made Easy (WSME) simplify the writing of REST web services by
 providing simple yet powerful typing which removes the need to directly
 manipulate the request and the response objects.
 .
 WSME can work standalone or on top of your favorite Python web (micro)
 framework, so you can use both your preferred way of routing your REST requests
 and most of the features of WSME that rely on the typing system like:
 .
  * Alternate protocols, including ones supporting batch-calls
  * Easy documentation through a Sphinx extension
 .
 WSME is originally a rewrite of TGWebServices with focus on extensibility,
 framework-independance and better type handling.

 node classes have additional methods and attributes for different
 usages.  They include some support for static inference and local name
 scopes.  Furthermore, astroid builds partial trees by inspecting living
 objects.
 .
 Main modules are:
 .
   * `bases`, `node_classses` and `scoped_nodes` contain the classes for the
     different type of nodes of the tree.
 .
   * the `manager` contains a high level object to get astroid trees from
     source files and living objects. It maintains a cache of previously

Package: python3-dbusmock
Description-md5: 3559901ef85e98d3f1852eaa0250da7d
Description-en: mock D-Bus objects for tests (Python 3)
 With python-dbusmock you can easily create mock objects on D-Bus. This is
 useful for writing tests for software which talks to D-Bus services such as
 upower, systemd, ConsoleKit, gnome-session or others, and it is hard (or
 impossible without root privileges) to set the state of the real services to
 what you expect in your tests.
 .
 Mock objects look like the real API (or at least the parts that you actually
 need), but they do not actually do anything (or only some action that you
 specify yourself). You can configure their state, behaviour and responses as
 you like in your test, without making any assumptions about the real system
 status.
 .
 You can use this with any programming language, as you can run the mocker as a
 normal program. The actual setup of the mock (adding objects, methods,
 properties, etc.) all happen via D-Bus methods on the
 org.freedesktop.DBus.Mock interface. You just don't have the convenience
 D-Bus launch API that way.

  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

Package: python3-sqlalchemy
Description-md5: ab3e4e16d880158a692652f7aeb4779d
Description-en: SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python 3
 SQLAlchemy is an SQL database abstraction library for Python.
 Its strengths are:
  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Package: python3-stevedore
Description-md5: 8c04b322fc21b52834676c8a9e0ed455
Description-en: manage dynamic plugins for Python applications - python3
 Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure and
 extend your application by discovering and loading extensions (plugins) at
 runtime. Many applications implement their own library for doing this, using
 __import__ or importlib. stevedore avoids creating yet another extension
 mechanism by building on top of setuptools entry points. The code for managing
 entry points tends to be repetitive, though, so stevedore provides manager
 classes for implementing common patterns for using dynamically loaded
 extensions.

Package: quilt
Description-md5: 8eeb0522bc56c3acd93b9e763f3dcd28
Description-en: Tool to work with series of patches
 Quilt manages a series of patches by keeping track of the changes
 each of them makes. They are logically organized as a stack, and you can
 apply, un-apply, refresh them easily by traveling into the stack (push/pop).
 .
 Quilt is good for managing additional patches applied to a package received
 as a tarball or maintained in another version control system. The stacked
 organization is proven to be efficient for the management of very large patch
 sets (more than hundred patches). As matter of fact, it was designed by and
 for Linux kernel hackers (Andrew Morton, from the -mm  branch, is the
 original author), and its main use by the current upstream maintainer is to
 manage the (hundreds of) patches against the kernel made for the SUSE
 distribution.
 .
 This package provides seamless integration into Debhelper or CDBS,
 allowing maintainers to easily add a quilt-based patch management system in
 their packages. The package also provides some basic support for those not
 using those tools. See README.Debian for more information.

Description-md5: fdb4578fd1d88489eda410ee8b1f7b20
Description-en: Router Advertisement Daemon
 IPv6 has a lot more support for autoconfiguration than IPv4. But
 for this autoconfiguration to work on the hosts of a network, the
 routers of the local network have to run a program which answers
 the autoconfiguration requests of the hosts.

 On Linux this program is called radvd, which stands for Router
 ADVertisement Daemon. This daemon listens to router solicitations (RS)
 and answers with router advertisement (RA). Furthermore unsolicited
 RAs are also sent from time to time.

   * Rake supports rule patterns to sythesize implicit tasks.
   * Rake is lightweight. It can be distributed with other
     projects as a single file. Projects that depend upon
     rake do not require that rake be installed on target
     systems.

Description-en: Binary diff tool for signature-based differences
 rdiff is a little like diff and patch all rolled into one, with support for
 binary files. Since it takes advantage of the rsync remote-delta algorithm, you
 do not need the source file in the same place as your destination file.
 .
 To use it, you generate a "signature" of the original file and copy the
 signature (which is very small) to the same location as the modified file. Then
 you generate a "delta" which describes the changes required to turn the source
 file into the modified file. The small delta file can then be used to "patch"
 the original file, to transform it into the modified file.

 A text-formatting package based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup
 Language), which allows you to produce TeX/DVI/PS/PDF, HTML, RTF, and
 plain ASCII (currently via w3m by default) from a single source with
 other recommended and suggested packages; due to the flexible nature
 of SGML, many other target formats are possible.

 HTML can be generated without any other Debian text processing package,
 but for the other formats the appropriate packages have to be installed.
 You need to install lynx or w3m for ASCII text output (w3m is the default
 txt backend).  Also jadetex is required for PS and PDF, and
 linuxdoc-tools for ld2db conversion.
 .
 This system is tailored for writing technical software documentation,
 an example of which are the Linux HOWTO documents.  However, there is
 nothing Linux-specific about this package; it can be used for many
 other types of documentation on many other systems.  It should be
 useful for all kinds of printed and online documentation.
 .
 The package was formerly called linuxdoc-sgml because it originates
 from the Linux Documentation Project (LDP).  The name has been changed
 into sgmltools to make it clearer that there is no Linux-specific
 stuff included in this package.

Package: swift-account

Description-en: distributed virtual object store - account server
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.

Package: t1utils
Description-md5: abf1d47b8ca1b485d148651358fc9283
Description-en: Collection of simple Type 1 font manipulation programs
 The t1utils tools allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB
 (binary) formats; disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable
 form; and reassemble the human-readable files into PFA or PFB format
 files.  You can also  extract font resources from a Macintosh font
 file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a
 PFA or PFB font.
 .
 There are currently six programs:
 .
  t1ascii   Converts PFB files to PFA format.
 .
  t1binary  Converts PFA files to PFB format.
 .
  t1disasm  Disassembles a Type 1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a raw,
            human-readable text form for subsequent hand editing,
            tweaking, hint fixing, etcetera...
 .
  t1asm     Assembles a Type 1 font into PFA or PFB format from
            the human-readable form produced by t1disasm.
 .
  t1unmac   Extracts POST resources from a Macintosh Type 1 font file
            (ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use outside
            the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file should be
            stored in MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex
            format, or as a raw resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does
            not have to run on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh Type 1
            fonts available for use on Unix machines and PCs.
 .
  t1mac     Creates a Macintosh Type 1 file from a PFA- or PFB-format
            Type 1 font. Writes the Macintosh file in MacBinary,
            AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex format, or as a raw
            resource fork.  WARNING: This tool will not suffice to
            allow you to use the new font on a Macintosh, as
            Macintoshes cannot read raw Type 1 fonts.  You will need
            to create a font suitcase containing bitmap fonts.  If you
            do not already have such a suitcase for the font, T1utils
            will not help you create one.

Description-md5: 8d0a96fd726e068c365e12ba1bdb9fda
Description-en: Access much of the Toshiba laptop hardware interface
 Toshset is a command-line tool to allow access to much of the
 Toshiba laptop hardware interface developed by Jonathan Buzzard. It can do
 things like set the hard drive spin-down time, turn off the display
 and set the fan speed without the help of the kernel.
 Toshset requires an experimental version of the toshiba_acpi kernel module
 with an ACPI-enabled kernel. Otherwise it works only if the laptop supports
 the old APM BIOS. (The last of these was produced something like 5 years ago)
 Please read README.Debian how to install the experimental version of the
 toshiba_acpi kernel module. (Ubuntu users don't need it)
 .
 This package also includes the Toshsat1800-irdasetup by Daniele Peri.  It
 can be used to configure IrDA for laptops with ALI1533 bridge (LPC47N227
 SuperIO), smc-ircc and not initializing BIOS (tested on Toshiba Satellite
 1800-514).  Homepage: http://www.csai.unipa.it/peri/toshsat1800-irdasetup/

Package: ttf-unifont
Description-md5: 90d7c54e33c62ff0f413a481253489be
Description-en: TrueType version of GNU Unifont
 This contains two fonts: "Unifont" and "Unifont Sample".
 .
 unifont.ttf is a bitmap font converted into a scalable TrueType
 outline font, Unifont.  Each pixel in the original bitmap font
 is represented as an outlined square.  The font provides a glyph
 for each visible code point (character) in the Unicode Basic
 Multilingual Plane (Plane 0).  Plane 0 contains most of the
 world's modern writing scripts.  This font looks best at 12pt.
 .
 unifont_sample.ttf is an SBIT font that contains combining circles
 and is therefore suitable for illustrating individual Unicode glyphs.
 unifont.ttf does not contain combining circles and so is suitable
 for general-purpose writing.
 .
 Complex fonts (such as Indic or Semitic scripts, where letters
 change shape depending on their position in a word, or such as
 Mongolian, which is written vertically) will not render perfectly.
 The philosophy behind this font, though, is that anything meaningful
 is better than an empty box for a unknown glyph.

Package: ucf
Description-md5: 83e3ff2859524c831253d938da348878
Description-en: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

 This package is a convenient way to install both the PCF bitmap

 (intended for general-purpose use) and "Unifont Sample" (which contains
 combining circles to use for illustration purposes).  It also installs
 a copy of unifont.hex and related files in /usr/share/unifont.
 .
 GNU Unifont was designed to render something besides an empty box
 for each visible Unicode character in the Basic Multilingual Plane
 (Plane 0).  Plane 0 contains most of the world's modern writing
 scripts.  This font looks best at 12pt.
 .
 Complex fonts (such as Indic or Semitic scripts, where letters
 change shape depending on their position in a word, or such as
 Mongolian, which is written vertically) will not render perfectly.
 The philosophy behind this font, though, is that anything meaningful
 is better than an empty box for a unknown glyph.

Description-en: mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop" USB devices
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act
 like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If
 the driver is already installed, the storage device vanishes and
 a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
 "ZeroCD" feature.

Description-md5: 63a4a740bcd9e8e94bf661e4f1806e02

 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description-en: scalable fonts for X
 xfonts-scalable provides fonts that can be drawn at any size by the X server
 or font server without loss of quality.  In most cases it is desirable to
 have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server installed to make the fonts
 available to X clients.
 .
 This package is missing three fonts from the X.Org source archives
 because the license terms on the fonts do not meet the Debian Free
 Software Guidelines; they are the Type1 fonts Adobe Utopia, IBM Courier,
 and Bigelow & Holmes (B&H) Luxi.
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.

Package: xfonts-unifont
Description-md5: 8e141e66af37a4f88539c6e40f5177cb
Description-en: PCF (bitmap) version of GNU Unifont
 This contains two fonts: "Unifont" (unifont.pcf.gz) and
 "Unifont Sample" (unifont_sample.pcf.gz).
 .
 This is a bitmap version of Unifont and Unifont Sample in a
 standard X11 format.  The fonts provide a glyph for each visible
 code point (character) in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane
 (Plane 0).  Plane 0 contains most of the world's modern writing
 scripts.  These fonts look best at 12pt.
 .
 Unifont Sample contains combining circles for combining characters,
 and so is suited for illustrating individual Unicode glyphs, whereas
 Unifont is intended for general-purpose writing.
 .
 Complex fonts (such as Indic or Semitic scripts, where letters
 change shape depending on their position in a word, or such as
 Mongolian, which is written vertically) will not render perfectly.
 The philosophy behind Unifont, though, is that anything meaningful
 is better than an empty box for a unknown glyph.
 .
 Consider using the TrueType version instead (ttf-unifont), because
 that version is scalable to any point size and has proper combining
 character support.

Package: xfonts-utils
Description-md5: cfb627fb99a0d0ef5d7b0b2f94423328
Description-en: X Window System font utility programs
 xfonts-utils provides a set of utility programs shipped with the X Window
 System that are needed for font management.
 .
 The programs in this package include:
  - bdftopcf, which converts BDF fonts to PCF fonts;
  - bdftruncate and ucs2any, tools to generate fonts with various encodings
    from ISO 10646-encoded fonts
  - mkfontdir, a program to generate fonts.dir files;
  - mkfontscale, a program to generate fonts.scale files;
  - fonttosfnt, a program to wrap bitmap fonts in a sfnt (TrueType) wrapper.

Package: xfpt
Description-md5: 4f18f0f9f6e01f72c3d25e523873f3ee
Description-en: generate XML from plain text
 xfpt is a program that reads a file of plain text that contains relatively
 simple markup, and outputs an XML file. It is intended to simplify the
 management of XML data. It is not a program that attempts to turn a plain text
 document into XML. Markup within text is introduced by ampersand characters,
 but is otherwise "soft". You can define what follows the ampersand, for
 example, &" to generate a "quote" element. There is also a macro facility that
 allows for higher level concepts such as chapters, displays, tables, etc.

Package: xfsdump
Description-md5: 8448ced317c37d3587808bf000f24a98
Description-en: Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem
 The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of
 other administrative utilities for managing XFS filesystems.
 .
 xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be
 backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
 storage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
 dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
 attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can
 thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
 and also between IRIX machines.
 .
 xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a
 full backup of a filesystem.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
 be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
 subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups.

Package: xfslibs-dev
Description-md5: 54fdf1338d81d394bfd209d85009d7c8
Description-en: XFS filesystem-specific static libraries and headers
 xfslibs-dev contains the libraries and header files needed to
 develop XFS filesystem-specific programs.
 .
 XFS is a high performance journaling filesystem which originated
 on the SGI IRIX platform.  It is completely multi-threaded, can
 support large files and large filesystems, extended attributes,
 variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of
 Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance
 and scalability.

Description-en: Synaptics TouchPad driver for X.Org server
 This package provides an input driver for the X.Org X server to enable
 advanced features of the Synaptics Touchpad including:
 .
  * Movement with adjustable, non-linear acceleration and speed
  * Button events through short touching of the touchpad
  * Double-Button events through double short touching of the touchpad
  * Dragging through short touching and holding down the finger on the touchpad
  * Middle and right button events on the upper and lower corner of the touchpad
  * Vertical scrolling (button four and five events) through moving the finger
    on the right side of the touchpad
  * The up/down button sends button four/five events
  * Horizontal scrolling (button six and seven events) through moving the finger
    on the lower side of the touchpad
  * The multi-buttons send button four/five events, and six/seven events for
    horizontal scrolling
  * Adjustable finger detection
  * Multifinger taps: two finger for middle button and three finger for right
    button events. (Needs hardware support. Not all models implement this
    feature.)
  * Run-time configuration using shared memory. This means you can change
    parameter settings without restarting the X server (see synclient(1)).
  * It also provides a daemon to disable touchpad while typing at the keyboard
    and thus avoid unwanted mouse movements (see syndaemon(1)).
 .

Package: xterm
Description-md5: c1e47d60a01948be9aae7a2a4f63a0fe
Description-en: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

Package: xvfb
Description-md5: ff95e4399e5ec034de6998347673eb73
Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.

Package: xz-utils
Description-md5: ea97a558c8575aebbed2c11cbd20e0f2
Description-en: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Package: yapps2
Description-md5: e0daec7e8417eea1a6ad27d120598d3d

 used when regular expressions are not enough and other parser systems
 are too much: situations where you might otherwise write your own
 recursive descent parser.
 .
 This package contains several upward-compatible enhancements to the
 original YAPPS source:
 .
     - handles recursive input ("include files")
     - better error reporting
     - reads input incrementally

Package: yui-compressor
Description-md5: bd069b00e0a22b6335e050845844bcb7
Description-en: JavaScript/CSS minifier
 The YUI Compressor is a JavaScript compressor which, in addition to removing
 comments and white-spaces, obfuscates local variables using the smallest
 possible variable name. This obfuscation is safe, even when using constructs
 such as 'eval' or 'with' (although the compression is not optimal is those
 cases) Compared to jsmin, the average savings is around 20%.
 .
 The YUI Compressor is also able to safely compress CSS files. The decision
 on which compressor is being used is made on the file extension (js or css).

Package: zerofree
Description-md5: 262e6e46f0838142d423e7e4b5195bfe
Description-en: zero free blocks from ext2, ext3 and ext4 file-systems
 Zerofree finds the unallocated blocks with non-zero value content in
 an ext2, ext3 or ext4 file-system and fills them with zeroes
 (zerofree can also work with another value than zero). This is mostly
 useful if the device on which this file-system resides is a disk
 image. In this case, depending on the type of disk image, a secondary
 utility may be able to reduce the size of the disk image after
 zerofree has been run. Zerofree requires the file-system to be
 unmounted or mounted read-only.
 .
 The usual way to achieve the same result (zeroing the unused
 blocks) is to run "dd" do create a file full of zeroes that takes up
 the entire free space on the drive, and then delete this file. This
 has many disadvantages, which zerofree alleviates:
  * it is slow;
  * it makes the disk image (temporarily) grow to its maximal extent;
  * it (temporarily) uses all free space on the disk, so other
    concurrent write actions may fail.
 .
 Zerofree has been written to be run from GNU/Linux systems installed
 as guest OSes inside a virtual machine. If this is not your case, you
 almost certainly don't need this package. (One other use case would
 be to erase sensitive data a little bit more securely than with a
 simple "rm").
