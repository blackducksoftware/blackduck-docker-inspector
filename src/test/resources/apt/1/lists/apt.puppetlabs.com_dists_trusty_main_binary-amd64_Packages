Description: Puppet master common scripts
 This package contains common scripts for the puppet master,
 which is the server hosting manifests and files for the puppet nodes.
 .
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
 using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the
 separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users,
 cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like
 packages, services, and files.
 .
 Puppet's simple declarative specification language provides powerful
 classing abilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while
 allowing them to be as specific as necessary, and it handles dependency
 and prerequisite relationships between objects clearly and explicitly.

Description: Puppet master common scripts
 This package contains common scripts for the puppet master,
 which is the server hosting manifests and files for the puppet nodes.
 .
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
 using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the
 separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users,
 cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like
 packages, services, and files.
 .
 Puppet's simple declarative specification language provides powerful
 classing abilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while
 allowing them to be as specific as necessary, and it handles dependency
 and prerequisite relationships between objects clearly and explicitly.

Description: Centralised configuration management - master setup to run under mod passenger
 This package provides a puppetmaster running under mod passenger.
 This configuration offers better performance and scalability.
 .
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
 using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the
 separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users,
 cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like
 packages, services, and files.
 .
 Puppet's simple declarative specification language provides powerful
 classing abilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while
 allowing them to be as specific as necessary, and it handles dependency
 and prerequisite relationships between objects clearly and explicitly.

Description: Centralized configuration management - master startup and compatibility scripts
 This package contains the startup and compatibility scripts for the puppet
 master, which is the server hosting manifests and files for the puppet nodes.
 .
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
 using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the
 separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users,
 cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like
 packages, services, and files.
 .
 Puppet's simple declarative specification language provides powerful
 classing abilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while
 allowing them to be as specific as necessary, and it handles dependency
 and prerequisite relationships between objects clearly and explicitly.

Description: Centralized configuration management
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
 using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the
 separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users,
 cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like
 packages, services, and files.
 .
 Puppet's simple declarative specification language provides powerful
 classing abilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while
 allowing them to be as specific as necessary, and it handles dependency
 and prerequisite relationships between objects clearly and explicitly.
 .
 This package contains the puppet software and documentation.  For the startup
 scripts needed to run the puppet agent and master, see the "puppet" and
 "puppetmaster" packages, respectively.

Description: Centralized configuration management
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
 using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the
 separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users,
 cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like
 packages, services, and files.
 .
 Puppet's simple declarative specification language provides powerful
 classing abilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while
 allowing them to be as specific as necessary, and it handles dependency
 and prerequisite relationships between objects clearly and explicitly.
 .
 This package contains the puppet software and documentation.  For the startup
 scripts needed to run the puppet agent and master, see the "puppet" and
 "puppetmaster" packages, respectively.

 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
 using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the
 separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users,
 cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like
 packages, services, and files.
 .
 Puppet's simple declarative specification language provides powerful
 classing abilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while
 allowing them to be as specific as necessary, and it handles dependency
 and prerequisite relationships between objects clearly and explicitly.

Description: Razor is an advanced provisioning application
 Razor is an advanced provisioning application which can deploy both bare-metal
 and virtual systems. It's aimed at solving the problem of how to bring new
 metal into a state where your existing DevOps/configuration management
 workflows can take it over.
 .
 Newly added machines in a Razor deployment will PXE-boot from a special Razor
 Microkernel image, then check in, provide Razor with inventory information, and
 wait for further instructions. Razor will consult user-created policy rules to
 choose which preconfigured model to apply to a new node, which will begin to
 follow the model's directions, giving feedback to Razor as it completes various
 steps. Models can include steps for handoff to a DevOps system such as Puppet
 or to any other system capable of controlling the node (such as a vCenter
 server taking possession of ESX systems).

Description: Razor is an advanced provisioning application
 Razor is an advanced provisioning application which can deploy both bare-metal
 and virtual systems. It's aimed at solving the problem of how to bring new
 metal into a state where your existing DevOps/configuration management
 workflows can take it over.
 .
 Newly added machines in a Razor deployment will PXE-boot from a special Razor
 Microkernel image, then check in, provide Razor with inventory information, and
 wait for further instructions. Razor will consult user-created policy rules to
 choose which preconfigured model to apply to a new node, which will begin to
 follow the model's directions, giving feedback to Razor as it completes various
 steps. Models can include steps for handoff to a DevOps system such as Puppet
 or to any other system capable of controlling the node (such as a vCenter
 server taking possession of ESX systems).
