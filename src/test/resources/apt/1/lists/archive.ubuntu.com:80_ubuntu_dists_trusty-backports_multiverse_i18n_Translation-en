Package: boinc-nvidia-cuda
Description-md5: 9384e2173f2ed43c0d057c1770da614c
Description-en: metapackage for CUDA-savvy BOINC client and manager
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 Regular users (righteously) often find it an unbearable nuisance to
 care for the exact configuration of BOINC for CUDA-savvy graphics
 cards. This package adds a series of dependencies from the non-free
 section to the regular boinc package. This also meant this binary
 package to be redistributed in the contrib section of Debian.

Package: iucode-tool
Description-md5: 85b8e9a4d04e1dafc3c5baa7e46a23a4
Description-en: Intel processor microcode tool
 iucode_tool is a program to manipulate IntelÂ® X86 and X86-64 processor
 microcode collections, and to use the kernel facilities to upgrade the
 microcode on Intel system processors.
 .
 It can load microcode data files in text and binary format, sort, list and
 filter the microcodes contained in these files, write selected microcodes to a
 new file in binary format, or upload them to the kernel.
 .
 It operates on non-free microcode data downloaded directly from Intel or
 installed by the intel-microcode package.

Package: nvidia-modprobe
