Description-en: NVIDIA OpenCL ICD
 OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a multivendor open standard for
 general-purpose parallel programming of heterogeneous systems that include
 CPUs, GPUs and other processors.
 .
 This package provides the NVIDIA installable client driver (ICD) for OpenCL
 which supports NVIDIA GPUs.

Package: nvidia-340
Description-md5: 799c2721fb542d4478fdbc19901a8f31
Description-en: NVIDIA binary driver - version 340.102
 The binary driver provide optimized hardware acceleration of OpenGL
 applications via a direct-rendering X Server. AGP, PCIe, SLI, TV-out
 and flat panel displays are also supported.
 .
 This package also includes the source for building the kernel module
 required by the Xorg driver, and provides NVIDIA's implementation of
 the Video Decode and presentation API. The latter enables acceleration
 for GeForce 8 and later series cards for h264 video.
