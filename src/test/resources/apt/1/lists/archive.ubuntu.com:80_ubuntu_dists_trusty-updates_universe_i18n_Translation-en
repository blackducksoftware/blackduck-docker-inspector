 Apt-Cacher NG keeps a copy of all useful data that passes through it, and when
 a similar request is made, the cached copy of the data is delivered without
 being re-downloaded.
 .
 Apt-Cacher NG has been designed from scratch as a replacement for
 apt-cacher, but with a focus on maximizing throughput with low system
 resource requirements. It can also be used as replacement for apt-proxy and
 approx with no need to modify clients' sources.list files.

 Ardour supports pro-audio interfaces
 through the ALSA project, which provides high quality, well designed
 device drivers and API's for audio I/O under Linux. Any interface
 supported by ALSA can be used with Ardour. This includes the
 all-digital 26 channel RME Hammerfall, the Midiman Delta 1010 and many
 others.

 non-destructive and capable of all standard non-linear editing
 operations (insert, replace, delete, move, trim, select,
 cut/copy/paste). The editor has unlimited undo/redo capabilities and can
 save independent "versions" of a track or an entire piece
 .
 Ardour's editor supports the community-developed LADSPA
 plugin standard.  Arbitrary chains of plugins can be attached to any
 portion of a track.  Every mixer strip can have any number of inputs
 and outputs, not just mono, stereo or 5.1.  An N-way panner is
 included, with support for various panning models.  Pre- and post-fader
 sends exist, each with their own gain and pan controls.  Every mixer
 strip acts as its own bus, and thus the bus count in Ardour is
 unlimited.  You can submix any number of strips into another
 strip.
 .
 Ardour's channel capacity is limited only
 by the number on your audio interface and the ability of your disk
 subsystem to stream the data back and forth.
 .
 JACK
 (the JACK Audio Connection Kit) is used for all audio I/O, permitting
 data to be exchanged in perfect samplesync with other applications
 and/or hardware audio interfaces.
 .
 Ardour is
 sample rate and size neutral - any hardware formats from 8 to 32 bits,
 and rates from 8kHz to 192kHz.  Internal processing in 32/64 bit IEEE
 floating point format.

Description-md5: 9b99c06c4d826846f96198235e941192
Description-en: copy initramfs modules into root filesystem for later use
 When booting with an external-to-root kernel and initramfs, you need
 to ensure that /lib/modules contains any necessary modules not already
 loaded.
 .
 This package arranges for the modules in the initramfs to be placed
 into /lib/modules after the switchroot is done.

Package: cloud-initramfs-dyn-netconf
Description-md5: 1a41b583d318bc06bd63e44e8b7af400
Description-en: write a network interface file in /run for BOOTIF

 network interfaces formated file to /run/network/interfaces with
 entries for any devices that were configured during initramfs.

Package: cloud-initramfs-growroot
Description-md5: 2a0d4bed7bada9873cf69d658abe0c23
Description-en: automatically resize the root partition on first boot
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed, the initramfs will repartition a disk to make the
 root volume consume all space that follows it.
 .
 You most likely do not want this package unless you know what you are
 doing.  It is primarily interesting in a virtualized environment when
 a disk can provisioned with a size larger than its original size.
 In this case, with this package installed, you can automatically use
 the new space without requiring a reboot to re-read the partition table.

Package: cloud-initramfs-rescuevol
Description-md5: bd1aa20bccdfa138c49bcdbb3244b5c9
Description-en: boot off a rescue volume rather than root filesystem
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed the initramfs will check to see if any partitions
 with a label of 'RESCUE_VOL' are attached.  If such a volume is attached,
 it will boot off that volume rather than the root volume.
 .
 This is useful in a cloud environment, when the user is able to attach
 and detach volumes to a running system, but has no other mechanism
 for interupting of fixing a failed boot.  It is analogous to inserting
 a rescue CD into a system to recover from failure.

 .
 NOTE: the schroot package provides a better implementation of

  * dchroot quoting issues are not present.  dchroot runs commands in
    the chroot with -c option of the user's default shell; when
    multiple command options are used, the options are concatenated
    together, separated by spaces.  This concatenation breaks shell
    quoting.
  * schroot implements fine-grained access controls based on users
    and groups, either of which may be granted the ability to gain
    root access to the chroot if required.
 Using schroot will avoid these issues, as well as provide additional
 functionality dchroot does not possess.

 .
 NOTE: the schroot package provides a better implementation of
 dchroot-dsa.  In particular:
  * dchroot-dsa only allows the specification of a single command with
    an absolute path, and no options may be used with the command;
    schroot allows the use of relative and absolute paths with no
    limit on the number of options.
  * dchroot-dsa only allows one chroot to be used at once; schroot will
    allow the use of as many chroots as desired.
  * dchroot-dsa allows access to be restricted to named users; schroot
    implements finer-grained access controls based on users and groups,
    either of which may be granted the ability to gain root access to
    the chroot if required.
 Using schroot will avoid these issues, as well as provide significant
 additional functionality dchroot-dsa does not possess.

Description-en: Go tool for use with gccgo
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and
 efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
 that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its
 novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.
 Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of
 garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a
 dynamically typed, interpreted language.

Package: golang-mux-dev
Description-md5: e8b7a6d8ad775de125d0f7589be4aca6
Description-en: URL router and dispatcher
 gorilla/mux implements a request router and dispatcher.
 .
 The name mux stands for "HTTP request multiplexer". Like the standard
 http.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of
 registered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL
 or other conditions. The main features are:
 .
  * Requests can be matched based on URL host, path, path prefix, schemes,
    header and query values, HTTP methods or using custom matchers.
  * URL hosts and paths can have variables with an optional regular
    expression.
  * Registered URLs can be built, or "reversed", which helps maintaining
    references to resources.
  * Routes can be used as subrouters: nested routes are only tested if the
    parent route matches. This is useful to define groups of routes that
    share common conditions like a host, a path prefix or other repeated
    attributes. As a bonus, this optimizes request matching.
  * It implements the http.Handler interface so it is compatible with the
    standard http.ServeMux.

Description-en: multiuser module for Apache
 The mpm-itk module, although not technically a Multi-Processing Module (MPM)
 (although it used to be) enhances the classical "prefork" module (that is,
 without threads), in such a way that it allows you to constrain each
 individual vhost to a particular system user and group. This allows you to run
 several different web sites on a single server without worrying that they will
 be able to read each others' files. mpm-itk is largely independent of e.g.
 what scripting technology is in use on your server; in particular, it does not
 require you to run your scripts as CGI to get the extra security benefit.

 Boost.Context is a foundational library that provides a sort of
 cooperative multitasking on a single thread. By providing an
 abstraction of the current execution state in the current thread,
 including the stack (with local variables) and stack pointer, all
 registers and CPU flags, and the instruction pointer, a fcontext_t
 instance represents a specific point in the application's execution

Description-en: provides a sort of cooperative multitasking on a single thread
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Boost.Coroutine provides templates for generalized subroutines which
 allow multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at
 certain locations. It preserves the local state of execution and
 allows re-entering subroutines more than once (useful if state must
 be kept across function calls).
 .
 Coroutines can be viewed as a language-level construct providing a
 special kind of control flow.
 .
 In contrast to threads, which are pre-emptive, coroutine switches are
 cooperative (programmer controls when a switch will happen). The
 kernel is not involved in the coroutine switches.
 .
 The implementation uses Boost.Context for context switching.

Package: libphp-phpmailer
Description-md5: f0c2ef8a131f4afc3cade50aa01ac564
Description-en: full featured email transfer class for PHP
 Many PHP developers utilize email in their code.  The only PHP function
 that supports this is the mail() function.  However, it does not expose
 any of the popular features that many email clients use nowadays like
 HTML-based emails and attachments. There are two proprietary
 development tools out there that have all the functionality built into
 easy to use classes: AspEmail(tm) and AspMail.  Both of these
 programs are COM components only available on Windows.
 .
 PhpMailer implements the same methods (object calls) that the Windows-based
 components do.
 .
 Class Features:
  - Send emails with multiple TOs, CCs, BCCs and REPLY-TOs
  - Redundant SMTP servers
  - Multipart/alternative emails for mail clients that do not read HTML email
  - Support for 8bit, base64, binary, and quoted-printable encoding
  - Uses the same methods as the very popular AspEmail active server (COM)
    component
  - SMTP authentication
  - Native language support
  - Word wrap

Package: nettle-bin
Description-md5: b9c201f42c4b4fea02c357189015a9c0
Description-en: low level cryptographic library (binary tools)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains binary utilities that accompany the library:
 .
    - nettle-lfib-stream - generates a pseudo-random stream, using the Knuth
      lfib (non-cryptographic) pseudo-random generator.
    - sexp-conv - conversion tool for handling the different flavours of sexp
      syntax.
    - pkcs1-conv - converts PKCS#1 keys to sexp format.
    - nettle-hash - command-line tool to compute message digests such as SHA-1.

Package: python-dbusmock
Description-md5: 3629dacf014f3c6c1882a79a79cbda2d
Description-en: mock D-Bus objects for tests (Python 2)
 With python-dbusmock you can easily create mock objects on D-Bus. This is
 useful for writing tests for software which talks to D-Bus services such as
 upower, systemd, ConsoleKit, gnome-session or others, and it is hard (or
 impossible without root privileges) to set the state of the real services to
 what you expect in your tests.
 .
 Mock objects look like the real API (or at least the parts that you actually
 need), but they do not actually do anything (or only some action that you
 specify yourself). You can configure their state, behaviour and responses as
 you like in your test, without making any assumptions about the real system
 status.
 .
 You can use this with any programming language, as you can run the mocker as a
 normal program. The actual setup of the mock (adding objects, methods,
 properties, etc.) all happen via D-Bus methods on the
 org.freedesktop.DBus.Mock interface. You just don't have the convenience
 D-Bus launch API that way.

Package: rng-tools
Description-md5: 6da2aca3dd07b55b609d9cf3d5d7cd57
Description-en: Daemon to use a Hardware TRNG
 The rngd daemon acts as a bridge between a Hardware TRNG (true random number
 generator) such as the ones in some Intel/AMD/VIA chipsets, and the kernel's
 PRNG (pseudo-random number generator).
 .
 It tests the data received from the TRNG using the FIPS 140-2 (2002-10-10)
 tests to verify that it is indeed random, and feeds the random data to the
 kernel entropy pool.
 .
 This increases the bandwidth of the /dev/random device, from a source that
 does not depend on outside activity.  It may also improve the quality
 (entropy) of the randomness of /dev/random.
 .
 A TRNG kernel module such as hw_random, or some other source of true
 entropy that is accessible as a device or fifo, is required to use this
 package.
 .
 This is an unofficial version of rng-tools which has been extensively
 modified to add multithreading and a lot of new functionality.

Description-md5: 7de15bde951264e5f9603202d2a74a72
Description-en: distributed virtual object store - common files
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Package: tor-geoipdb
Description-md5: d0b50c9cd91157b8c85856fd55e26d14
Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Package: websockify
Description-md5: 337cbf4b14d9c875bd13ec09c109dd7e
Description-en: WebSockets support for any application/server
 websockify was formerly named wsproxy and was part of the noVNC project.
 .
 At the most basic level, websockify just translates WebSockets traffic to
 normal socket traffic. Websockify accepts the WebSockets handshake, parses it,
 and then begins forwarding traffic between the client and the target in both
 directions.
 .
 Websockify supports all versions of the WebSockets protocol (Hixie and HyBi).
 The older Hixie versions of the protocol only support UTF-8 text payloads. In
 order to transport binary data over UTF-8 an encoding must used to encapsulate
 the data within UTF-8.
 .
 With Hixie clients, Websockify uses base64 to encode all traffic to and from
 the client. This does not affect the data between websockify and the server.
 .
 With HyBi clients, websockify negotiates whether to base64 encode traffic to
 and from the client via the subprotocol header (Sec-WebSocket-Protocol). The
 valid subprotocol values are 'binary' and 'base64' and if the client sends
 both then the server (the Python implementation) will prefer 'binary'. The
 'binary' subprotocol indicates that the data will be sent raw using binary
 WebSocket frames. Some HyBi clients (such as the Flash fallback and older
 Chrome and iOS versions) do not support binary data which is why the
 negotiation is necessary.

Package: xdmx
Description-md5: d52dd645b5fa9daf3052065e2345991f
Description-en: distributed multihead X server
 Xdmx is a proxy X server that uses one or more other X servers as its
 display device(s). It provides multi-head X functionality for displays that
 might be located on different machines. Xdmx functions as a front-end X server
 that acts as a proxy to a set of back-end X servers. All of the visible
 rendering is passed to the back-end X servers. Clients connect to the Xdmx
 front-end, and everything appears as it would in a regular multi-head
 configuration. If Xinerama is enabled (e.g., with +xinerama on the command
 line), the clients see a single large screen.
